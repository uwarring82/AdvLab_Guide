# Advanced Physics Laboratory

## Unified Documentation

Version 1.0-RC

-----

## Foreword

This document governs the Advanced Physics Laboratory. It replaces scattered rules, unwritten expectations, and inherited customs with a single, visible structure.

**Three parts, three purposes:**

| Part | What it does | In plain language |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| I. Framework | States principles that cannot be overridden | The promises we make to you |
| II. Essay | Describes what each role commits to in spirit | What we are trying to do |
| III. Handbook | Contains enforceable rules with deadlines | The rulebook—if it's not here, it cannot be used against you |

**Why this structure?**

Mixing principles, intentions, and procedures creates ambiguity. Ambiguity disadvantages whoever has less power—usually students. Separating them protects everyone.

**About this version:**

This laboratory is undergoing slow, deliberate modernisation. This document reflects where we are, not where we hope to be. Some experiment instructions use legacy formats. Some accountability mechanisms are newer than others. We state what is true now and revise as things change.

**How to read this:**

- If you need to know what you must do → Part III (Handbook)
- If you need to know what cannot be violated → Part I (Framework)
- If you want to understand why → Part II (Essay)

-----

# Part I: Invariant Framework

## What This Document Is

This section lists six principles that always apply in the laboratory. No other part of this document may contradict them.

-----

## The Six Principles

### 1. Known Criteria

You can only be assessed using criteria you knew about before you did the work.

If the criteria were not accessible to you beforehand, any decision based on them cannot be enforced.

### 2. Proportional Authority

You can only be held responsible for things you could reasonably influence.

If you had no realistic way to change something, you cannot be held responsible for it.

### 3. Traceable Decisions

Every decision that affects your status in the course must have:

- A named person who made it
- A stated reason

If either is missing, the decision cannot be enforced.

### 4. Separation of Layers

Three things are kept separate:

- Why we do things (purpose)
- How we do things (procedure)
- Who decides (authority)

No document or decision may mix these in a way that makes it unclear which one is being used.

### 5. Symmetric Visibility

Every rule that applies to you must be visible to you.

The rules that define how decisions are made must also be visible to you.

If you cannot access a rule that is used against you, it cannot be enforced against you.

### 6. Correctable Error

One mistake does not end your participation.

If you acknowledge an error and follow a documented correction path, you cannot be excluded from the course for that error alone.

-----

## Accountability Structure

This section explains who is accountable to whom. Making it visible makes it easier to use.

### The Chain

```
Students → Tutors → Organisers → Dean of Studies
```

Everyone in the laboratory is accountable to someone. The chain is complete.

### How Accountability Differs by Role

|Role      |Accountable to   |Type of consequence                             |Speed    |Visibility|
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
|Students  |Tutors           |Grade consequences: marks, failure, exclusion   |Immediate|High      |
|Tutors    |Organisers       |Role consequences: formal note, removal from role|Slower   |Lower     |
|Organisers|Dean of Studies  |Institutional consequences: review, intervention|Slowest  |Lowest    |

The types of consequences differ. That is honest. But accountability exists at every level.

### What This Means

When escalation is possible and the process is known, problems are more likely to be addressed early. If the first step does not resolve an issue, there is a higher level you can contact. See Part III, Chapter 6 for escalation procedures.

-----

## Scope

This section states principles only. Procedures belong in Part III (Handbook). Commitments belong in Part II (Essay).

-----

## How This Section Changes

Anyone can propose a change in writing. Changes require review by two organisers, confirmation the change adds no procedures or duties, and a version number. Changes do not apply to past events. Frequent changes indicate a problem elsewhere.

-----

# Part II: Essay

This section describes what each role commits to in spirit. It cannot be enforced. For enforceable rules, see Part III (Handbook).

-----

## Why This Laboratory Exists

This is a place where we do physics together.

The laboratory has two phases with different purposes:

- **Learning phase** (preparation and lab work): This is not a test. You are here to learn. Mistakes are expected. Tutors teach. Questions are welcome.
- **Assessment phase** (written and oral reports): This is where assessment happens. Your reports are graded. The learning phase prepares you for this.

You will work with real instruments. You will face real uncertainty. Some days will be frustrating. Results will not always cooperate.

This is not failure. This is physics.

We believe that learning to work carefully under uncertainty is valuable. But careful work requires trust. Trust requires transparency.

-----

## What Organisers Commit To

We create and maintain the conditions for serious work.

We commit to:

- Making expectations visible before they apply
- Keeping things consistent across lab courses
- Taking care of instruments, spaces, and people
- Admitting when something is our fault
- Supporting tutors so they can support students

**Accountability:** Organisers are accountable to the dean of studies. You have the right to escalate.

-----

## What Tutors Commit To

We accompany students through the learning phase. We do not do the work for them. We do not leave students alone with it.

We are teachers, and we are still learning. We have more experience than students, but we do not have all the answers. This is honest.

We commit to:

- Being present and prepared to teach
- Answering honestly, even when the answer is "I don't know"
- Using authority carefully
- Giving feedback that helps, not feedback that impresses or discourages
- Asking for help when something is beyond us
- Learning from our own teaching

We are not examiners during the lab. We are not obstacles. We are here because we once stood where students stand now, and we remember what helped us learn.

**Accountability:** Tutors are accountable to organisers. You have the right to escalate.

-----

## What Students Commit To

We engage with the work seriously. Not because we are told to, but because serious engagement is the only way this becomes valuable.

**In the learning phase**, we commit to:

- Arriving prepared to learn (not already knowing everything)
- Taking responsibility for our learning, including our mistakes
- Respecting shared resources: instruments, time, attention
- Asking when we do not understand—this is expected, not weakness

**In the assessment phase**, we commit to:

- Producing reports that reflect our genuine understanding
- Engaging with feedback, even when it is hard to hear
- Meeting deadlines or communicating in advance

We are not here to tick boxes. We are here to learn physics. The reports show what we have learned.

**Accountability:** Students are accountable to tutors. The escalation paths in Part III apply to everyone.

-----

# Part III: Handbook

This section contains enforceable rules. Every rule has a specific action, deadline, and consequence. If something is not written here, it cannot be enforced against you.

## Chapter 1: Where Information Lives

|Information            |Location                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
|Rules and procedures   |This section                              |
|Principles             |Part I (Framework)                        |

|Experiment instructions|experiments folder (in the course materials)|
|Schedules, contacts, grades, safety records|ILIAS (the university course platform)|

**Note on experiment instructions:** Lab instructions vary in structure. This laboratory is undergoing slow, deliberate modernization. Legacy and new formats coexist and both are valid. Consistency will emerge gradually; forcing uniformity would compromise quality.

-----

## Chapter 2: Safety

These rules apply to everyone.

### 2.1 Training Requirement

**Rule:** Everyone who enters the laboratory must hold valid safety training.

**Deadline:** Training must be valid on the day you enter. Training is valid for 12 months after completion.

**Consequence of failure:**

- You may not enter the laboratory.
- For students: missed lab time counts against you.
- For tutors: you may not supervise until training is renewed.
- For organisers: you may not be present in the laboratory until training is renewed.

### 2.2 Required Training Modules

Before entering the laboratory, complete these modules on ILIAS:

- General laboratory safety
- Electrical safety
- Laser safety (if your experiment uses lasers)
- Radiation protection (if your experiment uses radioactive sources)
- Cryogenic safety (if your experiment uses cryogenics)

### 2.3 Three Safety Rules

These always apply:

1. **Know before you touch.** If you do not understand equipment, ask before using it.
2. **Report problems immediately.** If something breaks, sparks, leaks, or behaves unexpectedly, tell someone at once.
3. **Never work alone with hazardous equipment.** Check the experiment guide for when a second person is required.

**Consequence of violation:** Immediate removal from the laboratory for safety reasons. Repeated violations result in exclusion from the course (students) or removal from the role (tutors).

-----

## Chapter 3: For Students

### 3.1 Before Each Lab Session

**This is preparation for learning, not for a test.**

You should:

|Action                                      |Why                                              |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Complete safety training                    |Required to enter laboratory                     |
|Read the experiment guide                   |So your tutor can teach effectively              |
|Prepare for the 15-minute conversation      |So your lab time is productive                   |

If you arrive unprepared, your tutor will teach you—but your limited lab time may not be enough to complete the experiment well. Preparation protects your own learning.

### 3.2 The 15-Minute Conversation

Before measurements, you have a 15-minute conversation with your tutor. **This is part of the learning phase—not graded.**

**What you should be able to discuss:**

- What you are measuring and why it matters
- How the technique works (concept, not buttons)
- What you expect and what would surprise you
- Main sources of uncertainty

**What happens:** If you demonstrate understanding, you proceed. If you have gaps, your tutor teaches—that is their job. If significant preparation is missing, you may need to prepare further before proceeding.

### 3.3 During the Lab Session

You must:

- Record equipment identifiers, settings, and timestamps
- Note anomalies immediately (not later from memory)
- Stop and ask if you cannot explain what your next action will change

### 3.4 After the Lab Session

|Deliverable     |Default deadline                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
|Lab notebook    |End of session                                |
|Written report  |One week after your final lab session for that experiment|
|Oral report     |Accompanies written submission                |

**The oral report:** When you submit your written report, you give a 15-minute oral presentation of your main findings. Tutors attend; organisers may attend. This is part of the assessment phase.

**How grading works:** Tutors assess the written report and factor in the oral presentation. Tutors and organisers may deliberate on performance level and final grade. You will receive clear, careful feedback that explains your grade.

### 3.5 Consequences

**Learning phase** (no grade penalties): Inadequate preparation → tutor teaches. Safety violation → removal from session; repeated → course exclusion.

**Assessment phase** (grade penalties): Late reports → grade penalty. Repeated → may fail course. Academic integrity violation → institutional process.

-----

## Chapter 4: For Tutors

### 4.1 Safety Training

The rules in Chapter 2 apply to you.

**Additional rule:** You may not supervise if your safety training has expired.

### 4.2 Before Course Start

Before each lab course, you must:

- Test equipment for each experiment you will supervise
- Take measurements and analyse data to verify proper function
- Confirm you understand the experiment well enough to teach it
- Report problems to team members and organisers immediately

Equipment issues discovered early can be resolved. Issues discovered during student sessions waste everyone's time. Organisers assist with purchasing new equipment and consumables.

### 4.3 Attendance and Preparation

|Requirement                          |Consequence of failure                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Be present for all scheduled sessions|Notify organiser as early as possible; organiser arranges cover. Repeated unexcused absences are documented.|
|Be prepared to teach the experiment  |Unprepared sessions are documented. Students deserve a tutor who can help them learn.                       |

**You are still learning too.** Being prepared means understanding the experiment well enough to teach it, not knowing everything. If you encounter limits, acknowledge them honestly and seek help.

### 4.4 The 15-Minute Conversation

**Your role:** You are teaching, not examining.

- Listen for understanding, not memorisation
- Ask questions—this is a conversation
- If students have gaps, teach. That is your job.
- If a student is significantly unprepared, you may ask them to prepare further. Document this and the reason.
- If you encounter something you cannot explain, say so honestly and find help together

### 4.5 Feedback Deadlines

|Deliverable                  |Your deadline                                    |Consequence of missing deadline           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|Pre-lab conversation outcome |Immediate (before measurements)                  |Measurements start later; document reason |
|Notebook check               |Same session or next session                     |Documented                                |
|Written report feedback      |14 calendar days after submission                |Student may escalate; documented          |
|Oral report feedback         |Verbal: immediate. Written (if requested): 7 days|Documented                                |
|Resubmission feedback        |10 calendar days after resubmission              |Student may escalate; documented          |

**If you cannot meet a deadline:** Notify the student and an organiser before the deadline. State when you will deliver.

### 4.6 Grading

**The oral report:** You attend the student's 15-minute oral presentation when they submit their written report. Factor the oral presentation into the final report grade.

**Deliberation:** You may consult with organisers on grade level and final grade. This is normal, not a sign of uncertainty.

**Feedback:** Give clear, careful feedback that explains the grade. Critical feedback is expected—it helps students learn. Be honest and constructive.

|Requirement                                                     |Consequence of failure                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|Apply the same criteria to all students for the same experiment |Organiser review; may require re-grading|
|Do not change criteria after work is submitted                  |Decision may be overturned              |
|Document any grade that differs significantly from typical range|Organiser review                        |
|Store grades only on ILIAS                                      |Security review                         |

### 4.7 What You May Not Do

|Action                                                |Why                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Invent new assessment criteria after work is submitted|Violates Framework Principle 1      |
|Grant extensions beyond course policy                 |Refer to organiser                   |
|Exclude a student from the laboratory                 |Requires organiser decision          |
|Waive safety requirements                             |Not permitted                        |
|Supervise with expired safety training                |Not permitted                        |

### 4.8 Consequences

|Failure                   |Consequence             |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|Late feedback (once)      |Documented              |
|Late feedback (repeated)  |Formal discussion       |
|Late feedback (persistent)|May be removed from role|
|Grading inconsistency     |May require re-grading  |
|Safety training lapse     |Cannot supervise        |
|Safety violation          |May be removed from role|

**Student recourse:** Escalate to organiser (Chapter 6).

## Chapter 5: For Organisers

### 5.1 Safety Training

The rules in Chapter 2 apply to you.

### 5.2 Before Course Start

|Action                                      |Consequence of failure                                |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|Verify all tutors have valid safety training|Tutors cannot supervise; documented                   |

**Grading support:** You may attend oral reports and deliberate with tutors on performance levels and final grades.

### 5.4 Escalation Resolution

When someone escalates an issue to you:

1. Acknowledge receipt within 2 working days.
2. Gather information from all parties.
3. Decide based on documented criteria.
4. Communicate the decision in writing.
5. Document the decision and the reason.

If you need more than 10 working days, tell the affected parties and give a new deadline.

### 5.5 What You May Not Do

|Action                                     |Why                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Change a grade without discussion with tutor|Undermines tutor authority          |
|Ignore an escalation                       |Violates this handbook               |
|Fail to document decisions                 |Violates Framework Principle 3       |

A grade may be changed only after discussion with the tutor and with written reasons.

### 5.6 Consequences

|Failure                        |Consequence             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
|Missing escalation deadline    |May be escalated to dean|

|Failing to publish criteria    |Grades may be challenged|
|Pattern of failures            |Reported to dean        |

**Recourse:** If an organiser fails to respond, escalate to the dean of studies (Chapter 6).

-----

## Chapter 6: Escalation

Escalation means asking a person with responsibility at the next level to help resolve a problem. The accountability chain is defined in Part I (Framework).

### 6.1 Escalation Paths

|Problem                       |First step             |If unresolved          |Final authority             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
|Feedback not received         |Ask tutor              |Tell organiser         |Organiser decides           |
|Disagree with grade           |Ask tutor              |Tell organiser         |Organiser decides           |
|Unclear expectations          |Ask tutor              |Tell organiser         |Organiser clarifies         |
|Equipment not working         |Tell tutor             |Tell organiser         |Organiser resolves          |
|Safety concern                |Tell tutor or organiser|Tell organiser         |Institutional safety officer|
|Tutor not available           |Tell organiser         |—                      |Organiser resolves          |
|Problem with tutor conduct    |Tell organiser         |Tell dean of studies   |Institution decides         |
|Problem with student conduct  |Tutor tells organiser  |Institutional process  |Institution decides         |
|Problem with organiser conduct|Tell dean of studies   |—                      |Institution decides         |
|Organiser not responding      |Tell dean of studies   |—                      |Dean decides                |

### 6.2 How to Escalate (Students)

1. Try to resolve with your tutor first (unless the problem is the tutor).
2. If unresolved within 7 days, email the organiser (address on ILIAS).
3. Include: what happened, what you tried, what you want.
4. Keep copies of emails and messages, so nothing is lost.
5. If the organiser does not respond within deadlines, or if the problem is the organiser, email the dean of studies.

Escalating a problem in good faith must not lead to disadvantages.

### 6.3 How to Escalate (Tutors)

1. Try to resolve within your authority first.
2. If you cannot, email the organiser.
3. Include: what happened, what you did, what decision you need.
4. If the organiser does not respond within deadlines, escalate to the dean of studies.

### 6.4 Response Deadlines

|Escalation           |Acknowledgement         |Resolution              |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|Student to tutor     |Same or next session    |7 days                  |
|Student to organiser |2 working days          |10 working days         |
|Tutor to organiser   |2 working days          |10 working days         |
|Anyone to dean       |Per institutional policy|Per institutional policy|

If resolution takes longer, the responsible person must say so and give a new deadline.

-----

## Chapter 7: Consequences Overview

Consequences are detailed in role-specific chapters (3, 4, 5). Summary:

|Role      |Consequence type|Speed    |Accountable to  |
|----------|----------------|---------|----------------|
|Students  |Grade           |Immediate|Tutor           |
|Tutors    |Role            |Slower   |Organiser       |
|Organisers|Institutional   |Slowest  |Dean of Studies |

The types differ. The chain is complete. Details: see Part I (Framework) and role chapters above.

-----

## Chapter 8: Scientific Honesty

Scientific honesty is an indispensable prerequisite for all scientific work.

### Core Principles

- **Do not fabricate data.** Record what you observe, not what you expect.
- **Do not falsify data.** Do not alter, omit, or misrepresent results.
- **Do not plagiarise.** Acknowledge all sources. Use your own words.
- **Document everything.** Your lab notebook must allow others to verify your work.

### What This Means in Practice

- Record anomalies and unexpected results—they are often the most valuable data.
- If you make a mistake, cross it out (do not erase) and note what happened.
- Distinguish clearly between your measurements and values from literature.
- Cite all sources, including experiment instructions, textbooks, and discussions with others.

### Institutional Framework

The University of Freiburg's regulations on safeguarding academic integrity apply at all times. Violations are taken seriously and can result in failing the entire course.

# Appendix A: Grading Scheme

## Grade Scale

|Grade|Meaning        |
|-----|---------------|
|1.0  |sehr gut (excellent)|
|1.3  |               |
|1.7  |               |
|2.0  |gut (good)     |
|2.3  |               |
|2.7  |               |

|3.7  |               |
|4.0  |bestanden (passed)|
|5.0  |nicht bestanden (failed)|

## Overall Grade Calculation

The overall grade is the weighted average of all partial grades from labs and seminars.

**To pass:** The overall grade must be 4.0 or better.

**Failure conditions:**

- More than one report graded 5.0 → entire course failed
- More than two failed entrance procedures → entire course failed

## Course-Specific Weights

### FP-1 (B.Sc., 7 ECTS) — Seven lab experiments

|Component                              |Weight|
|---------------------------------------|------|
|5 experiments (short reports)          |1.0 each|
|2 experiments (detailed reports)       |1.5 each|

### FP-2 (M.Sc., 8 ECTS) — Three labs + seminar

|Component                              |Weight|
|---------------------------------------|------|
|Two one-week labs (scientific reports) |1.0 each|
|One two-week lab (scientific report)   |1.0  |
|Seminar presentation                   |2.0  |

### FP-EDU (M.Ed., 5 ECTS) — Three labs + special + seminar

|Component                              |Weight|
|---------------------------------------|------|
|2 experiments (short reports)          |1.0 each|
|1 experiment (detailed report)         |1.5  |
|Lab Special                            |1.0  |
|Seminar presentation                   |1.0  |

## Entrance Procedure Note

If a student's preparation is insufficient, the entrance procedure (15-minute conversation) must be repeated. In such cases, the final grade for that experiment cannot be better than 2.0.
