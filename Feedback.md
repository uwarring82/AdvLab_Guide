# Feedback Sheets — Advanced Laboratory Courses

**FP-2 (Master) & FP-EDU (Education)**  
University of Freiburg, Institute of Physics

-----

## Overview

We use two types of feedback sheets:

|Sheet                              |Phase            |Purpose                                 |Graded?|
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
|**Experiment Learning Sheet (ELS)**|During experiment|Supports learning and report preparation|No     |
|**Assessment Feedback Sheet (AFS)**|After submission |Documents exam assessment               |Yes    |

Learning feedback and exam feedback are kept separate on purpose.

## Rating Scale

All ratings use a 4-level scale:

|Rating|Meaning                     |
|------|----------------------------|
|3     |Exceeds expectations        |
|2     |Meets expectations          |
|1     |Partially meets expectations|
|0     |Does not meet expectations  |

-----

# 1. Experiment Learning Sheet (ELS)

*One sheet per experiment · Learning phase only*

**Goal:** Help students understand what is going well, what needs improvement, and what to address when writing the report.

**When:** Students receive this sheet after the findings session, before writing the report.

**Note:** This sheet supports learning. It does not affect grades.
