# Feedback Sheets — Advanced Laboratory Courses

**FP-2 (Master) & FP-EDU (Education)**  
University of Freiburg, Institute of Physics

---

## Overview

We use two types of feedback sheets:

| Sheet | Phase | Purpose | Graded? |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Experiment Learning Sheet (ELS)** | During experiment | Supports learning and report preparation | No |
| **Assessment Feedback Sheet (AFS)** | After submission | Documents exam assessment | Yes |

Learning feedback and exam feedback are kept separate on purpose. Ready to fill in forms are available on ILIAS.

---

## Rating Scale

All ratings use a 4-level scale:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 3 | Exceeds expectations |
| 2 | Meets expectations |
| 1 | Partially meets expectations |
| 0 | Does not meet expectations |

*For tutors: Use ratings to support discussion; focus feedback on what to improve next, not on the number.*

---

# 1. Experiment Learning Sheet (ELS)

*One sheet per experiment · Learning phase only*

**Goal:** Help students understand what is going well, what needs improvement, and what to address when writing the report.

**When:** Students receive this sheet after the findings session, before writing the report.

> **Note:** This sheet supports learning. It does not affect grades.  
> Early misunderstandings and unexpected results are a normal part of experimental work and do not reduce grades.

# Why This Structure Works

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Separation of learning and assessment | ELS during experiment, AFS after submission |
| Clarity | Same 4-level scale throughout |
| Fairness | Assessment based only on submitted work |
| Usefulness | Short, specific, actionable feedback |
| Transparency | Students know which feedback affects grades |
| Room for exploration | Learning feedback allows mistakes without grade consequences |

---

# Summary Table

| Sheet | When Used | What It Covers | Affects Grade? |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| ELS | After findings session | Entrance, lab work, findings | No |
| AFS-R | After report submission | Scientific content, analysis, formal requirements | Yes |
| AFS-S | After seminar | Scientific quality, presentation, didactic reflection (FP-EDU) | Yes |
