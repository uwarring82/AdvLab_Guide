## Course Architecture

| | FP-2 (Master) | FP-EDU (Education) |
|---|---|---|
| Experiments | 2× one-week with reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× two-week (no report) | 2× short reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× full report (weight 1.5) |
| Seminar | Presents two-week results (weight 2.0) | Labor-Spezial with didactic reflection (weight 1.5) |
| Pass threshold | Overall ≤ 4.0 | Overall ≤ 4.0 |

## Laboratory Hurdles — Each Experiment

| Hurdle | Format | Requirements |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **1. Entrance Session** | 15-min presentation + 30-min discussion | Present key physics; demonstrate understanding of what/why/how |
| **2. Active Lab + Labbook** | Throughout experiment | Engaged measurement; in-lab analysis; complete labbook |
| **3. Findings Session** | ~30-min presentation + 15-min discussion | Present findings with uncertainties; comparison to expectations |

**Limit:** >2 failed entrance sessions = course failure.

# Part I: Learning Phase

*Formative feedback only—no grade impact.*

## Before the Laboratory

**Both students and tutors:** Review the relevant physics. Most content draws on BSc lecture material.

**Students:**
1. Complete **laser and radiation safety training** before first entry.
2. **Three rules:** Know before you touch. Report problems immediately. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
3. Read the experiment guide thoroughly and prepare for entrance session.

**Tutors:** Verify safety training current; test equipment and take own measurements (2 weeks before); read course documentation.

---

## Hurdle 1: Entrance Session

- Team presents key physics principles and expected outcomes.
- 30-min discussion follows. Tutors participate as discussants, not examiners.
- **Outcomes:** Passed → proceed; Repeated (gaps clarified) → proceed, documented; Failed → reschedule, counts toward limit.

---

## Hurdle 2: Active Laboratory Work + Labbook

### Laboratory Conduct
- Stop and ask if uncertain. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
- Articulate actual reasoning, not what you think is expected.

### Labbook Practices
Your labbook must allow verification and reconstruction of your work.

**Record:** Equipment identifiers and settings | Timestamps | Raw data immediately (never loose paper first) | Anomalies as they occur | Procedure changes with reasons

**In-lab analysis—essential:**
- **Estimate results as you go.** Quick calculations reveal whether your setup works.
- **Check calibrations early.** Errors discovered on the last day waste the week.
- **Compare to expectations.** Orders-of-magnitude discrepancies need investigation.
- **Plot data during acquisition.** Trends and outliers become visible immediately.

*Problems caught during measurement can be fixed. Problems discovered during report writing cannot.*

### Tutors — Guidance & Intervention
- **Default:** Observe. Students lead.
- **Guide when stuck:** Ask clarifying questions, suggest directions—do not solve for them.
- **Intervene only under:** T1 (Safety) | T2 (Clear factual error, >90% confidence) | T3 (Process feedback)
- State trigger and reason; keep to ≤2 min; log before session ends.

---

## Hurdle 3: Findings Session

- Present key findings with uncertainties, comparison to expectations, unresolved questions.
- 15-min discussion follows.

---

# Part II: Exam Phase

*Assessed against pre-published criteria. No changes after submission.*

## Written Reports

**Deadline:** 7 calendar days after final session (lab days excluded).
**Late:** ≤3 days → 0.3 penalty | >3 days → may not be accepted
**Resubmission:** One opportunity if graded 5.0. Second 5.0 = course failure.
**FP-2:** Two-week experiment has no report (assessed via seminar).

### Report Requirements

| | Full Report (FP-2; FP-EDU Exp. 3) | Short Report (FP-EDU Exp. 1–2) |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion | Brief intro, essential method, results, key conclusions |
| Data | Clear visualisation, uncertainties stated | Core measurements with uncertainties |
| Analysis | Transparent assumptions, honest about limitations | Main pathway, key limitations noted |
| Interpretation | Connected to physics, alternatives acknowledged | Primary findings connected to physics |
| References | All sources; own words | Sources acknowledged; own words |

**Short report principle:** Same rigour, reduced scope. Quality over comprehensiveness.

**Tutor feedback:** 14 days (report) | 10 days (resubmission)

---

## Seminar (60 minutes)

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 min |
| Open discussion | ~15 min |
| Exam questions (organisers/tutors) | ~15 min |

**Requirements:** Coherent logical thread | Claims follow from evidence | Uncertainties acknowledged

- **FP-2:** Present two-week experiment results.
- **FP-EDU:** Labor-Spezial with integrated didactic reflection: How could this be communicated to learners? What adaptations would you propose?

# General Rules

## Safety — Non-Negotiable

- **Training:** Laser and radiation safety before first entry; renewal every 12 months.
- **Violations:** First minor → removal, retraining. Repeated/serious → course exclusion.
- **Emergency stop:** Anyone may halt activity. Cannot be disadvantaged for good-faith invocation.

## Escalation

1. Resolve with tutor (unless tutor is the problem)
2. If unresolved (7 days): email organiser
3. If organiser unresponsive: Dean of Studies

**Deadlines:** Acknowledgement 2 working days; resolution 10 working days.
**Protection:** Good-faith escalation cannot lead to disadvantage.

## Consequences

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Late report ≤3 / >3 days | 0.3 penalty / may not be accepted |
| Report graded 5.0 | Resubmission opportunity |
| Second report 5.0 | Course failure |
| >2 failed entrance sessions | Course failure |
| Safety violation | Removal → retraining → exclusion |

## Core Commitments

**Students:** Prepare thoroughly. Present honestly. Ask when uncertain. Meet deadlines or communicate early.

**Tutors:** Observe by default. Guide when stuck. Intervene only for safety, clear errors, or process. Assess against published criteria only.

**The system:** All criteria known before you begin. Every decision has a name and reason. Mistakes correctable. Divergence legitimate.
