# Advanced Laboratory Courses

**Applies to:** FP-2 (Master, 8 ECTS) and FP-EDU (Education, 5 ECTS)

---

## Course Architecture

**Two phases, cleanly separated:**
- **Learning Phase:** Preparation → entrance session → laboratory work → findings session. Formative feedback only—no grade impact. Safe space for questions and mistakes.
- **Exam Phase:** Written reports + seminar presentation. Assessed against pre-published criteria.

**Course components:**

| | FP-2 (Master) | FP-EDU (Education) |
|---|---|---|
| Experiments | 2× one-week with reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× two-week (no report) | 2× short reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× full report (weight 1.5) |
| Seminar | Presents two-week results (weight 2.0) | Exam phase of Labor-Spezial (weight 1.5) |
| Special | — | Labor-Spezial with didactic reflection |
| Pass threshold | Overall ≤ 4.0 | Overall ≤ 4.0 |

## Laboratory Hurdles — Requirements for Each Experiment

Each experiment has three mandatory hurdles. All must be passed to complete the experiment.

| Hurdle | What | Requirements |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **1. Entrance Session** | 15-min presentation + 30-min discussion | Present key physics principles; demonstrate understanding of what/why/how; engage in discussion |
| **2. Active Lab Work + Labbook** | Throughout experiment | Engaged measurement; in-lab analysis and calibration checks; complete labbook entries |
| **3. Findings Session** | ~30-min presentation + 15-min discussion | Present findings with uncertainties; comparison to expectations; unresolved questions |

# Part I: Learning Phase

*Formative feedback only—no grade impact. Safe space for questions and mistakes.*

## Before the Laboratory

### For Both Students and Tutors
- **Review the relevant physics** for each experiment. Most content draws on BSc introductory and advanced lecture material.

### For Students
1. **Complete safety training** before first entry: laser and radiation safety.
2. **Three simple rules:**
   - **Know before you touch.** If you do not understand equipment, ask before using it.
   - **Report problems immediately.** If something breaks, sparks, leaks, or behaves unexpectedly, tell someone at once.
   - **Never work alone with hazardous equipment.** Check the experiment guide for requirements.
3. **Read the experiment guide** thoroughly.
4. **Prepare for entrance session:** understand what you measure and why, how the technique works conceptually, what you expect vs. what would surprise you, main uncertainty sources.

### For Tutors
1. **Verify safety training current** (before semester).
2. **Test equipment** for assigned experiments (2 weeks before course).
3. **Take own measurements and verify analysis works** (2 weeks before course).
4. **Read course documentation** (before first session).

## Hurdle 1: Entrance Session (15-min presentation + 30-min discussion)

- Each team presents key physics principles; demonstrates understanding of what they measure and why, how the technique works, expected outcomes, main uncertainties.
- Open discussion follows (30 min). Tutors participate as discussants, not examiners.
- **Outcomes:** Passed → proceed to measurements; Repeated (gaps clarified, then passed) → proceed, documented; Failed → reschedule required, counts toward limit.
- **Limit:** >2 failed entrance sessions across all experiments = course failure.

## Hurdle 2: Active Laboratory Work + Labbook

### For Students — Laboratory Work
- **Stop and ask** if uncertain about next action.
- **Never work alone** with hazardous equipment.
- **Articulate actual reasoning**, not what you think is expected. Divergence is legitimate.

### For Students — Labbook Practices
Your labbook is your scientific record. It must allow verification and reconstruction of your work.

**What to record:**
- Equipment identifiers (serial numbers, model names)
- Settings and configurations before each measurement
- Timestamps for measurements and significant events
- Raw data immediately as acquired—never on loose paper first
- Anomalies and unexpected observations as they occur
- Changes to procedure and reasons for changes

**In-lab analysis—essential, not optional:**
- **Estimate results as you go.** Quick calculations during measurement reveal whether your setup is working correctly.
- **Check calibrations early.** A calibration error discovered on the last day wastes the entire week.
- **Compare to expectations.** If your preliminary numbers differ by orders of magnitude from theory, investigate before proceeding.
- **Plot data during acquisition** where feasible. Trends and outliers become visible immediately.

**Why this matters:** Problems caught during measurement can be fixed. Problems discovered during report writing cannot. The labbook is not bureaucracy—it is your protection against lost work and your evidence of scientific integrity.

### For Tutors — Observation, Guidance & Intervention
- **Default:** Observe. Students lead discussions.
- **Guide when stuck:** When teams seem stuck in their learning process, act as a guide—ask clarifying questions, suggest directions, help them find their footing. Do not solve for them.
- **Ask organisers for help** when situations exceed your authority or expertise.
- **Intervene only under three triggers:**
  - **T1 (Safety):** Physical risk emerging → intervene immediately.
  - **T2 (Factual):** Clear factual error (>90% confidence) blocking learning → intervene; else note for feedback.
  - **T3 (Process):** Feedback on participation, time, clarity—not scientific content.
- **When intervening:** Signal intention, state "Intervening under [T1/T2/T3]: [reason]", keep to ≤2 min (unless T1), log before session ends.

### Exploration & FP-EDU Didactic Exploration
- Exploration requires: declared scope, tethered claims (state what would falsify), specified return horizon.
- **FP-EDU:** Didactic questions explored alongside physics throughout—not deferred to end. Mark didactic exploration in logs.

### Labbook Completion
- Complete by end of each session. Must allow verification.
- Incomplete labbook → report cannot be properly assessed.

---

## Hurdle 3: Findings Session (~30-min presentation + 15-min discussion)

- Present key findings and reasoning. Not graded.
- Content: what you measured, key findings with uncertainties, comparison to expectations, unresolved questions.
- Open discussion follows (15 min).

---

# Part II: Exam Phase

*Assessed against pre-published criteria. No criteria changes after submission.*

## Written Reports
- **Deadline:** 7 calendar days after final session (laboratory days excluded).
- **Late submission:** ≤3 days → 0.3 grade penalty; >3 days → may not be accepted without prior arrangement.
- **Resubmission:** One opportunity if graded 5.0. Second report graded 5.0 = course failure.
- **FP-2 exception:** Two-week experiment has no written report.

### Full Report Requirements (FP-2 one-week; FP-EDU Experiment 3)
| Element | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion |
| Data | Clear presentation, appropriate visualisation, uncertainties stated |
| Analysis | Transparent assumptions, appropriate methods, honest about limitations |
| Interpretation | Connected to physics principles, alternatives acknowledged |
| References | All sources acknowledged; own words |

### Short Report Requirements (FP-EDU Experiments 1 & 2)
| Element | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Brief introduction, essential method, results, key conclusions |
| Data | Core measurements with uncertainties; essential visualisation only |
| Analysis | Main analysis pathway; assumptions stated; key limitations noted |
| Interpretation | Primary findings connected to physics; no exhaustive discussion required |
| References | Sources acknowledged; own words |

**Short report principle:** Same rigour, reduced scope. Focus on the essential findings and core reasoning. Quality of analysis matters more than comprehensiveness. A short report that demonstrates clear understanding of the key physics is better than a long report that obscures it.

### Tutor Feedback Deadlines
- Written report: 14 calendar days
- Resubmission: 10 calendar days
- If deadline cannot be met: notify student and organiser before deadline with new timeline.

## Seminar

### Session Structure (60 minutes)
| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 min | Student presents without interruption |
| Honest discussion | ~15 min | Open discussion, all participants |
| Exam questions | ~15 min | Focused questions from organisers/tutors |

### Presentation Requirements
- **Coherent:** Clear logical thread throughout.
- **Causally connected:** Claims follow from evidence and reasoning.
- **Inviting discussion:** Genuine questions, acknowledged uncertainties.

### Course-Specific Content
- **FP-2:** Present two-week experiment results. Weight 2.0.
- **FP-EDU:** Labor-Spezial with integrated didactic reflection throughout (not as afterthought). Address: How could this be communicated to learners? Conceptual challenges? Adaptation proposals?

# General Rules

## Safety — Non-Negotiable

- **Training required:** Laser and radiation safety before first entry; renewal every 12 months.
- **Three simple rules:** Know before you touch. Report problems immediately. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
- **Violations:** First minor → removal, retraining, documented. Repeated/serious → course exclusion.
- **Emergency stop:** Anyone may halt activity for safety concerns. Cannot be disadvantaged for good-faith invocation.

---

## Escalation Paths

| Step | Student | Tutor |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Resolve with tutor (unless tutor is problem) | Resolve within authority |
| 2 | If unresolved (7 days): email organiser | Email organiser |
| 3 | Include: what happened, what tried, what wanted | Include: what happened, what done, decision needed |
| 4 | If organiser unresponsive/is problem: Dean of Studies | If organiser unresponsive: Dean |

**Response deadlines:** Acknowledgement 2 working days; resolution 10 working days.
**Protection:** Good-faith escalation cannot lead to disadvantage.

## Consequences Summary

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Late report ≤3 days | Grade penalty (0.3) |
| Late report >3 days | May not be accepted |
| Report graded 5.0 | Resubmission opportunity |
| Second report graded 5.0 | Course failure |
| >2 failed entrance sessions | Course failure |
| Safety violation (first, minor) | Removal, retraining, documented |
| Safety violation (repeated/serious) | Course exclusion |
| Academic integrity violation | Institutional process |

---

## Core Commitments

**Students:** Prepare thoroughly. Present honestly. Ask when uncertain. Meet deadlines or communicate early.

**Tutors:** Observe by default. Intervene only for safety, clear errors, or process. State your reason. Give timely feedback. Assess against published criteria only.

**Organisers:** Publish all criteria before they apply. No retroactive rule changes. Respond to escalations within deadlines.

**The system:** All criteria known before you begin. Every decision has a name and reason. Mistakes correctable through defined paths. Divergence legitimate.
