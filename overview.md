## Course Architecture

| | FP-2 (Master) | FP-EDU (Education) |
|---|---|---|
| Experiments | 2× one- or two-week with full reports (each weight 1.0) | 3x two days with 2× short reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× full report (weight 1.5) |
| Seminar Experiment | Final experiment; assessed via final lab notes (30%) + seminar presentation (70%); combined weight 2.0 | Lab-Special; assessed via final lab notes (30%) + seminar presentation (70%); combined weight 1.5 |
| Pass threshold | Overall ≤ 4.0 | Overall ≤ 4.0 |

**Seminar assignment:** The seminar is always held on your final experiment. Organisers aim for balanced distribution across available experiments when assigning student schedules.

## Laboratory Hurdles — Each Experiment

| Hurdle | Format | Requirements |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **1. Entrance Session** | 15-min presentation + 30-min discussion | Present key physics; demonstrate understanding of what/why/how |
| **2. Active Lab + Lab Notes** | Throughout experiment | Engaged measurement; in-lab analysis; complete lab notes |
| **3. Findings Session** | ~30-min presentation + 15-min discussion | Present findings with uncertainties; comparison to expectations |

**Limit:** >2 failed entrance sessions = course failure.

# Part I: Learning Phase

*Formative feedback only—no direct grade impact.*

*Exception: For the seminar experiment, lab notes are submitted and assessed (see Part II).*

## Before the Laboratory

**Both students and tutors:** Review the relevant physics. Most content draws on BSc lecture material.

**Students:**
1. Complete **laser and radiation safety training** before first entry.
2. **Three rules:** Know before you touch. Report problems immediately. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
3. Read the experiment guide thoroughly and prepare for entrance session.

**Tutors:** Discuss specifc safety features with organisers; test equipment and take own measurements (2 weeks before); read course documentation.

---

## Hurdle 1: Entrance Session

- Team presents key physics principles and expected outcomes.
- 30-min discussion follows. Tutors participate as discussants, not examiners.
- **Outcomes:** Passed → proceed; Repeated (gaps clarified) → proceed, documented; Failed → reschedule, counts toward limit.

---

## Hurdle 2: Active Laboratory Work + Lab Notes

### Laboratory Conduct
- Stop and ask if uncertain. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
- Articulate actual reasoning, not what you think is expected.

### Lab Notes Practices
Your lab notes must allow verification and reconstruction of your work.

**Record:** Equipment identifiers and settings | Timestamps | Raw data immediately (never loose paper first) | Anomalies as they occur | Procedure changes with reasons

**In-lab analysis—essential:**
- **Estimate results as you go.** Quick calculations reveal whether your setup works.
- **Check calibrations early.** Errors discovered on the last day waste the week.
- **Compare to expectations.** Orders-of-magnitude discrepancies need investigation.
- **Plot data during acquisition.** Trends and outliers become visible immediately.

*Problems caught during measurement can be fixed. Problems discovered during report writing cannot.*

### Tutors — Guidance & Intervention
- **Default:** Observe. Students lead.
- **Guide when stuck:** Ask clarifying questions, suggest directions—do not solve for them.
- **Intervene only under:** T1 (Safety) | T2 (Clear factual error, >90% confidence) | T3 (Process feedback)
- State trigger and reason; keep to ≤2 min; log before session ends.

---

## Hurdle 3: Findings Session

- Present key findings with uncertainties, comparison to expectations, unresolved questions.
- 15-min discussion follows.

---

# Part II: Exam Phase

*Assessed against pre-published criteria. No changes after submission.*

## Written Reports (Experiments 1 & 2)

**Deadline:** 7 calendar days after final session (lab days excluded).
**Late:** ≤3 days → 0.3 penalty | >3 days → may not be accepted

### Report Requirements

| | Full Report (FP-2) | Short Report (FP-EDU Exp. 1–2) |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion | Brief intro, essential method, results, key conclusions |
| Data | Clear visualisation, uncertainties stated | Core measurements with uncertainties |
| Analysis | Transparent assumptions, honest about limitations | Main pathway, key limitations noted |
| Interpretation | Connected to physics, alternatives acknowledged | Primary findings connected to physics |
| References | All sources; own words | Sources acknowledged; own words |

**Short report principle:** Same rigour, reduced scope. Quality over comprehensiveness.

**Tutor feedback:** 14 days (report)

---

## Seminar Experiment (Experiment 3) — FP-2

The seminar experiment replaces the written report with a seminar presentation. To ensure traceability of analysis and assessment of laboratory work, **lab notes must be submitted**.

### Assessment Structure

| Component | Weight | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Lab Notes | 30% | 3 calendar days before seminar |
| Seminar Presentation | 70% | Scheduled date |
| **Combined** | **2.0** (course weight) | |

### Lab Notes Submission Requirements

Lab notes for the seminar experiment must be submitted as a complete, legible document (scan or digital original). Beyond standard lab notes practices, the submission must include:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Completeness** | All raw data recorded with timestamps; equipment identified; settings documented |
| **Traceability** | Analysis steps follow logically from raw data; assumptions stated; calculations reproducible |
| **Key Results Identified** | Final numerical results clearly marked; uncertainties stated; comparison to expectations noted |
| **Anomaly Documentation** | Unexpected observations recorded; response actions noted |
| **Legibility** | Readable without oral explanation; structure navigable |

**Assessment:** Lab notes are assessed on whether they permit independent verification of results and reconstruction of methodology—not on prose style or visual polish.

**Deadline:** 3 calendar days before scheduled seminar.

| Submission | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| On time | Seminar proceeds |
| 1–3 days late | 0.3 penalty; seminar proceeds or rescheduled |
| >3 days late | 0.7 penalty; seminar rescheduled |
| Not submitted by rescheduled date | Combined grade 5.0 (resubmission pathway applies) |

**Rescheduling:** Next available slot within examination period. No slot available → course incomplete.

**Extensions:** Written request before deadline with documentation (illness, family emergency, comparable). Workload is not grounds for extension.

### Seminar Presentation (60 minutes)

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 min |
| Open discussion | ~15 min |
| Exam questions (organisers/tutors) | ~15 min |

**Requirements:** Coherent logical thread | Claims follow from evidence | Uncertainties acknowledged | Results traceable to submitted lab notes

---

## Lab-Special — FP-EDU

FP-EDU students complete a dedicated experiment and seminar with integrated didactic reflection. To ensure traceability and assess laboratory work, **lab notes must be submitted**.

### Assessment Structure

| Component | Weight | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Lab Notes | 30% | 3 calendar days before seminar |
| Seminar Presentation | 70% | Scheduled date |
| **Lab-Special Combined** | **1.5** (course weight) | |

### Lab Notes Submission Requirements

Lab notes requirements are identical to FP-2 (see above): Completeness, Traceability, Key Results Identified, Anomaly Documentation, Legibility.

### Didactic Reflection Components

The seminar presentation integrates experimental findings with didactic reflection:

- How could this experiment be communicated to learners at different levels?
- What conceptual difficulties might learners encounter?
- What adaptations or scaffolding would you propose?

**Assessment:** The presentation is assessed on both scientific rigour (results, uncertainties, methodology) and quality of didactic reasoning.

# General Rules

## Safety — Non-Negotiable

- **Training:** Laser and radiation safety before first entry; renewal every 12 months.
- **Violations:** First minor → removal, retraining. Repeated/serious → course exclusion.
- **Emergency stop:** Anyone may halt activity. Cannot be disadvantaged for good-faith invocation.

## Escalation

1. Resolve with tutor (unless tutor is the problem)
2. If unresolved (7 days): email organiser
3. If organiser unresponsive: Dean of Studies

**Deadlines:** Acknowledgement 2 working days; resolution 10 working days.
**Protection:** Good-faith escalation cannot lead to disadvantage.

## Consequences

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Safety violation | Removal → retraining → exclusion |
| >2 failed entrance sessions | Course failure |
| Late report ≤3 / >3 days | 0.3 penalty / may not be accepted |
| Late lab notes (seminar exp.) | Seminar may be postponed; late penalty at organiser discretion |
| Report graded 5.0 | None |
| Second report 5.0 | Course failure |
| Lab notes + seminar combined 5.0 (FP-2 & FP-EDU) | Resubmission of lab notes + repeat seminar opportunity |

---

## Core Commitments

**Students:** Prepare thoroughly. Present honestly. Ask when uncertain. Meet deadlines or communicate early.

**Tutors:** Observe by default. Guide when stuck. Intervene only for safety, clear errors, or process. Assess against published criteria only.

**The system:** All criteria known before you begin. Every decision has a name and reason. Mistakes correctable. Divergence legitimate.
