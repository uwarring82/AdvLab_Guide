# Welcome to the Advanced Physics Laboratory

A 10-minute read before your first day.

-----

## What this document is

This is not the rulebook. The rulebook exists (it's called the Unified Documentation, and it's on ILIAS). This document helps you understand what you're walking into, so you can arrive feeling prepared rather than anxious.

-----

## The short version

You're going to do real physics with real equipment. Some days will be frustrating. That's normal. You have support, you have protections, and one bad day doesn't define your grade.

-----

## What actually happens

### Before the lab

You read the experiment instructions. You don't need to memorise everything—you need to understand what you're measuring and why.

When you arrive, you have a 15-minute conversation with your tutor. This is not an exam. It's a check that you're ready to use your lab time well. If you have gaps, your tutor teaches you. That's their job.

### During the lab

You do the experiment. You take notes. You ask questions.

Things will go wrong. Equipment behaves unexpectedly. Measurements don't match predictions. This is physics, not failure. Write down what actually happened, not what you wish had happened.

Your tutor is there to help. They're not watching to catch mistakes—they're watching to help you learn.

### After the lab

You write a report. You give a short presentation of your findings. This is where grades happen.

The lab work itself? That's for learning. The report? That's for showing what you learned.

## Common fears (addressed honestly)

**"What if I don't understand the theory?"**

That's why you have a tutor. The 15-minute conversation at the start exists precisely to fill gaps before you begin. Come prepared to learn, not already knowing everything.

**"What if I mess up the experiment?"**

You probably will, at some point. Everyone does. Document what happened, talk to your tutor, figure out what went wrong. This is how experimental physics works.

**"What if my results are wrong?"**

"Wrong" results that are honestly documented and thoughtfully analysed can earn good grades. Fabricated "right" results are academic misconduct. We care about your process, not just your numbers.

**"What if I fail the entrance conversation?"**

The conversation has three possible outcomes:
- **Passed**: You understood enough. Proceed.
- **Repeated**: You had gaps, your tutor taught you, you got there. Proceed. No grade impact.
- **Failed**: You weren't ready even after teaching. Come back another day.

"Failed" is rare. It means you genuinely couldn't engage with the material even with help. If you did the reading and showed up willing to learn, you'll be fine.

**"What if I have a problem with my tutor?"**

There's an escalation path. Talk to the organiser. If that doesn't work, there's a dean of studies. This is documented and you're protected. See the Quick Reference in the main document.

**"What if I make one big mistake?"**

One mistake doesn't end your participation. That's literally one of the six principles in the Framework. If you acknowledge the error and work to fix it, you cannot be excluded for that alone.

## What we expect from you

- **Show up prepared.** Read the instructions. Not perfectly—but enough to have questions.
- **Be honest.** Record what happened. Ask when you don't understand. Don't pretend.
- **Engage.** This works when you're actually trying to learn, not just trying to survive.

That's it. We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for genuine engagement with difficult material.

-----

## What you can expect from us

- **Visible rules.** If it's not written down, it can't be enforced against you.
- **Teaching, not trapping.** Tutors are there to help you succeed, not to catch you failing.
- **Fair assessment.** You'll only be graded on criteria you knew about beforehand.
- **Accountability.** If something goes wrong, there's always someone you can talk to.

## The two phases

This is important enough to say twice:

| Phase | What happens | Graded? |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Learning** (prep + lab) | You prepare, you do the experiment, you learn | No |
| **Assessment** (reports) | You write up what you learned, you present it | Yes |

The lab is not a test. The report is the test. The lab is where you do the work that makes the report possible.

-----

## Practical things

**Safety training:** Must be completed before you enter the lab. Do this on ILIAS. It's valid for 12 months.

**Lab notebook:** Bring one. Write in pen. Don't erase mistakes—cross them out and note what happened. This is your primary record.

**Report deadline:** One week after your final lab session for that experiment.

**Where to find everything:** ILIAS. Schedules, contacts, instructions, the full documentation—it's all there.

-----

## If you remember nothing else

1. **Prepare enough to have questions**, not enough to have all answers.
2. **Write down what actually happens**, not what should happen.
3. **Ask when you're stuck.** That's what tutors are for.
4. **The lab is for learning.** Grades come from reports.
5. **One bad day doesn't end everything.** There are protections. Use them if you need them.

-----

## Next steps

1. Complete safety training on ILIAS (before your first lab day).
2. Read the experiment instructions for your first experiment.
3. Show up ready to learn.

That's it. You've got this.
