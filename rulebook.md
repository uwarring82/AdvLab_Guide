# Advanced Laboratory Courses — Overview

**Applies to:** FP-2 (Master, 8 ECTS) and FP-EDU (Education, 5 ECTS)

---

## Course Architecture

| | FP-2 (Master) | FP-EDU (Education) |
|---|---|---|
| Experiments | 2× one- or two-week with full reports (each weight 1.0) | 3× two days with 2× short reports (each weight 1.0) + 1× full report (weight 1.5) |
| Seminar Experiment | Final experiment; assessed via short report (30%) + seminar presentation (70%); combined weight 2.0 | Lab-Special; assessed via short report (30%) + seminar presentation (70%); combined weight 1.5 |
| Pass threshold | Overall ≤ 4.0 | Overall ≤ 4.0 |

**Seminar assignment:** The seminar is always held on your final experiment. Organisers aim for balanced distribution across available experiments when assigning student schedules. Seminars will be scheduled by organisers as a suggestion. 

---

## Laboratory Steps — Each Experiment (lab hours typically form 9:00 till 17:30 h – coordinate details with your tutors)

| Step | Format | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **1. Entrance Session** | 15-min presentation + 30-min discussion | Present key physics; demonstrate understanding of what/why/how |
| **2. Active Lab + Lab Notes** | Throughout experiment | Engaged measurement; in-lab analysis; complete lab notes |
| **3. Findings Session** | ~30-min presentation + 15-min discussion | Present findings with uncertainties; comparison to expectations |

**Limit:** More than 2 failed entrance sessions results in course failure.

# Part I: Learning Phase

*Formative feedback only—no direct grade impact.*

*Exception: For the seminar experiment, short reports are submitted and assessed (see Part II).*

## Before the Laboratory

**Both students and tutors:** Review the relevant physics. Most content draws on BSc lecture material.

**Students:**
1. Complete **laser and radiation safety training** before first entry.
2. **Three rules:** Know before you touch. Report problems immediately. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
3. Read the experiment guide thoroughly and prepare for entrance session.

**Tutors:** Discuss specific safety features with organisers; test equipment and take own measurements (2 weeks before); read course documentation.

---

## Step 1: Entrance Session

- Team presents key physics principles and expected outcomes.
- A 30-min discussion follows. Tutors participate as discussants, not examiners.
- **Outcomes:** Passed → proceed; Repeated (gaps clarified) → proceed, documented; Failed → reschedule, counts toward limit.

---

## Step 2: Active Laboratory Work + Lab Notes

### Laboratory Conduct
- Stop and ask if uncertain. Never work alone with hazardous equipment.
- Articulate actual reasoning, not what you think is expected.

### Lab Notes Practices
Your lab notes must allow verification and reconstruction of your work.

**Record:** Equipment identifiers and settings | Timestamps | Raw data immediately (never loose paper first) | Anomalies as they occur | Procedure changes with reasons

**In-lab analysis—essential:**
- **Estimate results as you go.** Quick calculations reveal whether your setup works.
- **Check calibrations early.** Errors discovered on the last day waste the week.
- **Compare to expectations.** Orders-of-magnitude discrepancies require investigation.
- **Plot data during acquisition.** Trends and outliers become visible immediately.

*Problems caught during measurement can be fixed. Problems discovered during report writing cannot.*

### Tutors — Guidance & Intervention
- **Default:** Observe. Students lead.
- **Guide when stuck:** Ask clarifying questions, suggest directions—do not solve for them.
- **Intervene only under:** T1 (Safety) | T2 (Clear factual error, >90% confidence) | T3 (Process feedback)
- State trigger and reason; keep to ≤2 min; log before session ends.

---

## Step 3: Findings Session

- Present key findings with uncertainties, comparison to expectations, and unresolved questions.
- A 15-min discussion follows.
- **Minimum requirement:** The presentation must include at least a qualitative discussion of each of the above points (findings with uncertainties, comparison to expectations, unresolved questions). Quantitative treatment where feasible strengthens the presentation.

---

# Part II: Exam Phase

*Assessed against pre-published criteria. No changes after submission.*

## General Report Requirements

All reports—whether full reports, short reports, or seminar short reports—must attach the following as appendices or properly referenced supplementary material:
- Lab notes (complete, legible)
- Raw data files
- All other relevant information collected during the work

This requirement ensures traceability and permits independent verification.

---

## Written Reports (Experiments 1 & 2)

**Deadline:** 7 calendar days after final session (lab days excluded).
**Late submission:** ≤3 days → 0.3 penalty | >3 days → may not be accepted

### Report Requirements

| | Full Report (FP-2) | Short Report (FP-EDU Exp. 1–2) |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion | Brief intro, essential method, results, key conclusions |
| Data | Clear visualisation, uncertainties stated | Core measurements with uncertainties |
| Analysis | Transparent assumptions, honest about limitations | Main pathway, key limitations noted |
| Interpretation | Connected to physics, alternatives acknowledged | Primary findings connected to physics |
| References | All sources; own words | Sources acknowledged; own words |
| Attachments | Lab notes, raw data, relevant supplementary material | Lab notes, raw data, relevant supplementary material |

**Short report principle:** Same rigour, reduced scope. Quality over comprehensiveness.

**Tutor feedback:** Within 14 days of submission.

---

## Seminar Experiment (Experiment 3) — FP-2

The seminar experiment replaces the full written report with a seminar presentation, accompanied by a short report that documents the analysis. The short report provides the written foundation; the seminar presentation develops this foundation into a complete scientific narrative.

### Assessment Structure

| Component | Weight | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Short Report | 30% | 7 calendar days before seminar |
| Seminar Presentation | 70% | Scheduled date |
| **Combined** | **2.0** (course weight) | |

### Short Report Requirements (FP-2 Seminar)

The short report for the FP-2 seminar experiment may use bullet points and keywords, since the seminar presentation provides the venue for full verbal articulation. However, the short report must comprehend full data analysis principles:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Analysis** | Complete analysis pathway documented; all steps from raw data to final results traceable |
| **Uncertainty Treatment** | Uncertainty propagation fully documented; sources identified; final uncertainties stated |
| **Assumptions** | All assumptions and approximations explicitly listed |
| **Comparison to Expectations** | Expected values stated; deviations noted and addressed |
| **Key Results** | Final numerical results clearly marked with uncertainties |
| **Attachments** | Lab notes, raw data, and all relevant supplementary material |

**Note on format:** Bullet points and keywords are acceptable for the short report body. The seminar presentation then develops these documented elements into a coherent scientific narrative with full verbal articulation and extended discussion.

**Deadline:** 7 calendar days before scheduled seminar.

| Submission | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| On time | Seminar proceeds as scheduled |
| 1–3 days late | 0.3 penalty applied; seminar proceeds or is rescheduled at organiser discretion |
| >3 days late | 0.7 penalty applied; seminar rescheduled |
| Not submitted by rescheduled date | Combined grade 5.0 (resubmission pathway applies) |

**Rescheduling:** Next available slot within examination period. If no slot is available, the course remains incomplete.

**Extensions:** Submit written request before deadline with documentation (illness, family emergency, or comparable circumstances). Workload alone does not constitute grounds for extension.

### Seminar Presentation (60 minutes)

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 min |
| Open discussion | ~15 min |
| Exam questions (organisers/tutors) | ~15 min |

**Requirements:** Coherent logical thread | Claims follow from evidence | Uncertainties acknowledged | Results traceable to submitted short report

---

## Lab-Special — FP-EDU

FP-EDU students complete a dedicated experiment and seminar with integrated didactic reflection. The seminar is accompanied by a short report that documents the analysis and provides the foundation for the presentation.

### Assessment Structure

| Component | Weight | Deadline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Short Report | 30% | 7 calendar days before seminar |
| Seminar Presentation | 70% | Scheduled date |
| **Lab-Special Combined** | **1.5** (course weight) | |

### Short Report Requirements (FP-EDU Lab-Special)

The short report must document the analysis with sufficient detail for traceability:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Analysis** | Analysis pathway documented; steps from raw data to results traceable |
| **Uncertainty Treatment** | Uncertainty sources identified; propagation documented; final uncertainties stated |
| **Assumptions** | Assumptions and approximations stated |
| **Comparison to Expectations** | Expected values and deviations noted |
| **Key Results** | Final results clearly marked with uncertainties |
| **Attachments** | Lab notes, raw data, and all relevant supplementary material |

**Deadline and late submission rules:** Same as FP-2 seminar experiment (see above).

### Didactic Reflection Components

The seminar presentation integrates experimental findings with didactic reflection:

- How could this experiment be communicated to learners at different levels?
- What conceptual difficulties might learners encounter?
- What adaptations or scaffolding would you propose?

**Assessment:** The presentation is assessed on both scientific rigour (results, uncertainties, methodology) and quality of didactic reasoning.

# General Rules

## Safety — Non-Negotiable

- **Training:** Laser and radiation safety training required before first entry; renewal every 12 months.
- **Violations:** First minor violation → removal and retraining required. Repeated or serious violation → course exclusion.
- **Emergency stop:** Anyone may halt activity for safety reasons. No one can be disadvantaged for good-faith invocation.

## Escalation

1. Attempt resolution with tutor first (unless the tutor is the subject of the concern)
2. If unresolved within 7 days: email organiser
3. If organiser is unresponsive: contact Dean of Studies

**Response deadlines:** Acknowledgement within 2 working days; resolution within 10 working days.
**Protection:** Good-faith escalation cannot lead to disadvantage.

## Consequences

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Safety violation | Removal → retraining required → exclusion for repeated violations |
| >2 failed entrance sessions | Course failure |
| Late report ≤3 / >3 days | 0.3 penalty / may not be accepted |
| Late short report (seminar exp.) | Seminar may be postponed; late penalty applies |
| Report graded 5.0 | No immediate consequence |
| Second report graded 5.0 | Course failure |
| Short report + seminar combined 5.0 (FP-2 & FP-EDU) | Resubmission of short report + repeat seminar opportunity |

---

## Core Commitments

**Students:** Prepare thoroughly. Present honestly. Ask when uncertain. Meet deadlines or communicate early.

**Tutors:** Observe by default. Guide when stuck. Intervene only for safety, clear errors, or process feedback. Assess against published criteria only.

**The system:** All criteria are known before you begin. Every decision has a name and reason. Mistakes are correctable. Divergence is legitimate.

# Appendix A: Checklist for Lab Notes / Short Reports

1. **Title and Date:** Each set of notes should have a clear title and the date of the lab work.
2. **Objective:** State the purpose or objective of the experiment or procedure.
3. **Materials and Equipment:** List all the materials and equipment used during the lab work.
4. **Procedure:** Document each step of the experiment, including any changes you made to the standard procedure.
5. **Observations and Data:** Record any observations made during the experiment and all data collected, including sketches and diagrams.
6. **Calculations and Analysis:** Include any calculations made using the data collected. Analyse recordings, estimate uncertainties, provide graphical representations with proper axis labels, and summarise findings.
7. **Interpretation and Conclusion:** Describe your interpretation of the data and any conclusions you draw from the experiment.
8. **Errors and Anomalies:** Record any errors, accidents, or anomalies observed during the lab work.
9. **Improvements and Suggestions:** Note any improvements or changes you would make to the experiment in the future.
10. **References:** Cite all resources that you referenced. This can be either a bibliography at the end or added in the text or as footnotes where used.
11. **Sign and Date:** Finally, sign and date each page. This is particularly important if your lab notes will be used as a legal document.

**General principles:** Lab notes should be detailed, clear, and in chronological order. They should be readable by others, not just yourself, and contain enough information for you to reproduce the experiment if needed. Short explanations should help the reader comprehend the steps taken to analyse the data. Good diagrams are essential. Longer text blocks are not necessary, except in the final "Discussion/Conclusion" section.

You choose your format, but a single file should be uploaded to ILIAS.

# Appendix B: Checklist for Full Scientific Reports

1. **Title:** The title should be descriptive, concise, and accurately reflect the content of your report.

2. **Abstract:** A brief summary (fewer than 200 words) outlining the motivations, goals, methods, and main results of the experiment, including uncertainties.

3. **Introduction:** This section should clearly state the topic, motivations, and any relevant historical background. It should also include the aim and hypothesis of your work. As a rough guideline, this should be around one page.

4. **Methods:** Describe the methods and procedures used in your experiment in the context of the underlying theory (including the relevant formulae), including the experimental setup, materials, and equipment.

5. **Analysis and Results:** Describe your findings in detail. Include graphical representations of data with uncertainties. Discuss your data analysis process, including how you quantified and distinguished statistical and systematic uncertainties.

6. **Discussion:** Summarise your findings and discuss how they relate to your introduction. State whether the measurement uncertainties were limited by statistical or systematic effects. Suggest ways to improve the methodologies used for more accurate results.

7. **Conclusions:** Briefly summarise the main points from your discussion and state your conclusion clearly.

8. **References:** Cite all sources that you referenced in your report using a consistent citation style. Ensure these sources are credible and can be verified by the reader.

9. **Appendices:** Include any additional information that supports your report but is too detailed or bulky to be included in the main body. This includes raw data, lab notes (required), and program codes used for your analysis.

**General principles:** Each section should be clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complex language. The purpose of a scientific report is to clearly and accurately communicate your research and findings. Carefully proofread your report for errors in spelling, grammar, and consistency in style before submission.

Submit your report as a single file via ILIAS.

# Appendix C: Checklist for Seminar Presentations

Your seminar presentation should last approximately 30 minutes. If there is more than one presenter, divide this time sensibly among the students. You can create your presentation in PowerPoint, OpenOffice, or (preferably) PDF format. Ensure your presentation is understandable to students who have not conducted your experiment by using clear, precise language. Discuss and refine your presentation's content with your lab assistant or mentor before delivering your seminar. Rehearse your presentation to ensure smooth delivery.

After your talk, there will be a discussion period lasting 20 minutes. This time serves as an opportunity for further exploration of your topic and for others to ask questions. Your seminar will be evaluated based on the quality of your slides, the delivery of your oral presentation, and the depth of your background knowledge.

## 1. Content

Your presentation should include the following sections:

a. **Motivation and Introduction:** Begin with the experiment's motivation and a brief overview of the topic.

b. **Theory:** Offer a succinct introduction to the theory relevant to your experiment.

c. **Experimental Setup, Methods, and Sequences:** Describe the experimental setup, methods used, and calibration measurements. Detail the measurement procedures and the parameters you adjusted and varied.

d. **Data Analysis:** Walk the audience through the journey from raw data to final results.

e. **Presentation of Final Results:** Share your final results succinctly. Discuss statistical and systematic uncertainties and, if applicable, compare your results to literature values or calculated values.

f. **Summary and Final Remarks:** Summarise your findings and suggest possible improvements to your results. Share an outlook or potential applications of your findings.

g. **Literature and Other Sources:** Cite your sources on each slide. This gives credibility to your work and helps others who might want to delve deeper into the topic.

## 2. Arrangement of Content

a. Organise your content in an optimal order for understanding.

b. Depending on your experiment, it may be necessary to select only the most important content for the presentation, rather than presenting all measurements.

c. Ensure the content is appropriately paced to fit within your allotted presentation time.

## 3. Style of Slides

a. Ensure all labels, keywords, and symbols are consistent and of an appropriate size.

b. Refrain from using abbreviations and jargon, which can confuse your audience.

c. Create slides that are structured concisely and are easy to comprehend. Do not overload slides with too much text.

d. Use well-sized labels for your illustrations, sketches, photos, and equations.

e. Show page numbers on the slides. This helps the audience refer to specific pages during the discussion.

f. Keep your figures and illustrations simple; avoid unnecessary or confusing details.

## 4. Oral Presentation

a. Address your talk to your peers, using language that will be understandable to those who did not conduct the experiment.

b. Engage your audience with clear, scientific language, avoiding slang or imprecise wording.

c. Discuss all shown illustrations, photos, figures, equations, and parameters in your presentation.

d. Highlight important details without getting lost in excessive detail.

e. Ensure your talk has a clear narrative thread ("roter Faden"), reflecting a well-structured and comprehensive presentation.
