# Advanced Laboratory Courses — Rulebook

**Applies to:** Master Laboratory (FP-2) and Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum Lehramt (FP-EDU)  
**Version:** 0.2 (Draft)  
**Status:** For review

---

## One-Page Summary

### What This Is

Advanced laboratory courses where you engage with physics as a scientist: making choices, recognising the unexpected, and reasoning through problems without pre-written solutions.

### The Two Phases

| Phase | Purpose | What Counts |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Learning Phase** | Build understanding through experiment and discussion | Formative feedback only — no grade impact |
| **Exam Phase** | Demonstrate understanding through reports and seminar | Written reports + oral seminar presentation |

### Each Experiment at a Glance

| When | What | Duration |
|------|------|----------|
| Before lab | Safety training, preparation, entrance conversation | — |
| Day 1 | Principles presentation + discussion | ~30 min per team |
| During lab | Measurements, analysis, honest discourse | Variable, but typically from Mon-Fri 9-17:30 h |
| Last day | Findings presentation + discussion | ~30 min per team |
| After lab | Written report (except FP-2 two-week) | 7 days (lab days excluded) |

### Seminar Session Structure (Exam Phase)

| Element | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 minutes |
| Honest discussion | ~15 minutes |
| Final exam questions (organisers and tutors) | ~15 minutes |
| **Total** | **60 minutes** |

### Written Report Expectations

A full scientific report must demonstrate:

| Element | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion |
| **Data** | Clear presentation, appropriate visualisation, uncertainties stated |
| **Analysis** | Transparent assumptions, appropriate methods, honest about limitations |
| **Interpretation** | Connected to physics principles, alternative explanations acknowledged |
| **References** | All sources acknowledged; own words used |

**FP-EDU short reports:** Same principles apply, but scope is reduced. Focus on key findings, essential analysis, and clear communication. Quality over length.

### Key Rules

- **Students:** Prepare thoroughly. Present honestly. Ask when uncertain. Meet deadlines or communicate early.
- **Tutors:** Observe by default. Intervene only for safety, clear factual errors, or process issues. State your reason. Give timely feedback.
- **Organisers:** Publish all criteria before they apply. Respond to escalations within deadlines. No retroactive rule changes.

### What Makes This Work

- All criteria are known before you begin
- Every decision affecting you has a name and a reason
- Mistakes are correctable through defined paths
- Divergence is legitimate — not every discussion needs consensus
- Escalation paths exist and cannot lead to disadvantage

### Course Differences

| Element | FP-2 (Master) | FP-EDU (Education) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Credit value | 8 ECTS | 5 ECTS |
| Experiments | 2 × one-week (reports) + 1 × two-week (no report) | 2 × short report + 1 × full report |
| Two-week results | Presented in seminar | — |
| Special component | — | Labor-Spezial (didactic reflection) |
| Seminar | Presentation of two-week results | Exam phase of Labor-Spezial |
| Didactic reflection | — | Required in both learning and exam phases |

---

## Part I: Course Structure

### Overview

The advanced laboratory is not about executing procedures. It is about understanding physics deeply enough to make decisions, recognise surprises, and reason through problems that have no pre-written solutions.

This requires trust — trust that your questions will be taken seriously, that mistakes are opportunities for learning, and that the system is fair. We earn that trust through structure, not promises.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Each course consists of laboratory experiments plus a seminar component.
2. The learning phase and exam phase are clearly separated.
3. Assessment criteria are published before work begins and cannot change after submission.
4. All participants — students, tutors, organisers — are bound by these rules.

### FP-2 (Master Laboratory)

| Component | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| One-week experiment 1 (report) | 1.0 | Written report required |
| One-week experiment 2 (report) | 1.0 | Written report required |
| Two-week experiment | — | No report; results presented in seminar |
| Seminar presentation | 2.0 | Presents two-week experiment results |

**Credit value:** 8 ECTS  
**To pass:** Overall grade ≤ 4.0

**Note:** The two-week experiment does not require a written report. Instead, students present their results in the seminar session, which forms the primary assessment for this experiment.

### FP-EDU (Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum Lehramt)

| Component | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Experiment 1 (short report) | 1.0 | Written report required |
| Experiment 2 (short report) | 1.0 | Written report required |
| Experiment 3 (full report) | 1.5 | Written report required |
| Labor-Spezial + Seminar | 1.5 | Seminar is exam phase of Labor-Spezial |

**Credit value:** 5 ECTS  
**To pass:** Overall grade ≤ 4.0

**Note:** The seminar presentation forms the exam phase of the Labor-Spezial. Both the learning phase (practical work, didactic exploration) and the exam phase (seminar presentation) must include didactic reflection.

---

## Part II: The Two Phases

### Learning Phase

The learning phase is where understanding is built. It includes preparation, the entrance conversation, laboratory work, and the daily presentations. During this phase, tutors support your learning — they do not assess your performance for grades.

You should feel safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and change your mind. That is what learning looks like.

**The following rules apply:**

1. The learning phase covers all activities from preparation through the final day of laboratory work.
2. Feedback during the learning phase is formative — it does not affect your grade.
3. The entrance conversation is part of the learning phase and is not graded.
4. Daily presentations (principles and findings) are part of the learning phase and are not graded.
5. Tutors may provide guidance, correction, and feedback throughout the learning phase.
6. Errors identified during the learning phase can be corrected without grade consequence.

**FP-EDU:** The learning phase of the Labor-Spezial includes practical work and didactic exploration. Didactic reflection is required during this phase — it is not something added only at the end.

### Exam Phase

The exam phase is where you demonstrate what you have learned. It consists of written reports (where applicable) and the oral seminar presentation. These are assessed against published criteria.

**The following rules apply:**

1. The exam phase begins after laboratory work ends.
2. Written reports are assessed against criteria published before the experiment began.
3. The seminar presentation is assessed against criteria published at the start of the course.
4. No new criteria may be introduced after submission.
5. Every grade includes written justification from a named tutor.
6. Grades may be questioned through defined escalation paths.

**FP-2:** The two-week experiment has no written report. The seminar presentation serves as the exam phase for this experiment.

**FP-EDU:** The seminar presentation forms the exam phase of the Labor-Spezial. Didactic reflection is required in the seminar — it must be integrated into the presentation, not treated as an afterthought.

---

## Part III: Before the Laboratory

### Preparation

Good laboratory work begins before you enter the room. Preparation is not optional — it is the foundation for everything that follows.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Complete all required safety training before your first laboratory session.
   - General laboratory safety: before first entry
   - Electrical safety: before first entry
   - Experiment-specific modules (laser, radiation, cryogenics): before that experiment
2. Read the experiment guide thoroughly before arriving.
3. Prepare for the entrance conversation by understanding:
   - What you are measuring and why it matters
   - How the technique works (concept, not buttons)
   - What you expect and what would surprise you
   - Main sources of uncertainty

### Entrance Conversation

The entrance conversation is a 15-minute discussion with your tutor before measurements begin. It verifies that you are prepared to use laboratory time effectively. It is part of the learning phase — not graded.

**The following rules apply:**

1. The entrance conversation takes place before measurements begin.
2. Tutors assess whether understanding is sufficient to proceed.
3. Possible outcomes:
   - **Passed:** Understanding demonstrated — proceed to measurements.
   - **Repeated:** Gaps identified, tutor clarified, understanding then demonstrated — proceed, documented, no grade impact.
   - **Failed:** Understanding not achieved — return to prepare; reschedule required; counts toward limit.
4. More than 2 failed entrance conversations across all experiments results in course failure.
5. The outcome is communicated immediately.

---

## Part IV: During the Laboratory

### Daily Presentations

Each experiment includes structured presentations that frame the work and consolidate learning. These presentations are part of the learning phase — they help you and your peers think clearly, but they are not graded.

**The following rules apply:**

**Day 1 — Principles Presentation:**
1. Each team presents the key principles underlying the experiment (~30 minutes total including discussion).
2. The purpose is to establish shared understanding before measurements begin.
3. Tutors and students discuss openly following the presentation.

**Last Day — Findings Presentation:**
1. Each team presents their key findings and reasoning (~30 minutes total including discussion).
2. The purpose is to consolidate understanding and surface remaining questions.
3. Tutors and students discuss openly following the presentation.

**Time allocation guidance:**
- Two-member teams: ~15 minutes presentation + ~15 minutes discussion
- Three-member teams: ~10 minutes per student + ~10 minutes shared discussion

**General presentation rules:**
1. Presentations should be concise, focused, and honest about uncertainties.
2. Discussion should be genuine inquiry — not performance.
3. Tutors participate as discussants, not examiners.
4. Divergent views are legitimate and may be recorded without forced resolution.

### Laboratory Work

The laboratory is where you engage with physics directly. You make choices, observe consequences, and reason through what you find.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Record equipment identifiers, settings, and timestamps in your notebook.
2. Note anomalies immediately — do not wait until analysis.
3. Stop and ask if uncertain about your next action.
4. Never work alone with hazardous equipment (check experiment guide for requirements).

### Honest Discourse

Learning happens through honest articulation — saying what you actually think, not what you imagine is expected. This requires an environment where questions are welcomed and mistakes are treated as information.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Students lead discussions about physics and method.
2. Tutors observe by default during student-led discussions.
3. Tutors may intervene only under specific triggers:
   - **Safety (T1):** A physical safety risk is emerging — intervene immediately.
   - **Factual (T2):** A clear factual error with high confidence would block learning — intervene if confident (>90%), otherwise note for feedback.
   - **Process (T3):** Feedback on how discussion is conducted (participation, time, clarity) — not on scientific content.
4. When tutors intervene, they state their reason briefly.
5. All interventions are logged.
6. Divergence is legitimate — discussions may end without consensus.

### Exploration

Some questions have no established answer. Some methods have not been tried. Exploration is encouraged — but disciplined.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Exploration requires a declared scope: what you are investigating, what is in bounds, what is out of bounds.
2. Claims must be tethered: you should be able to say what would show you wrong.
3. Untethered speculation is marked as such — not punished, but noted.
4. Exploration produces candidates, not conclusions. Conclusions require deliberation.
5. A return horizon must be specified: when will you report back?
6. If the return horizon passes without report, the matter is flagged.

### FP-EDU: Didactic Exploration

For Education students, didactic exploration is an integral part of the learning phase — not an optional extra.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Didactic questions (e.g., "How could this be adapted for school?") should be explored alongside physics questions.
2. Didactic exploration should be marked as such in logs.
3. Didactic claims are tethered to: pedagogical literature, curriculum requirements, practical feasibility.
4. Didactic exploration during laboratory work informs the Labor-Spezial and seminar presentation.
5. Didactic reflection is required in the learning phase — it cannot be deferred entirely to the exam phase.

---

## Part V: After the Laboratory

### Written Reports

The written report is your opportunity to demonstrate understanding. It is part of the exam phase and is assessed against published criteria.

**The following rules apply:**

1. Reports are due 7 calendar days after your final laboratory session for that experiment.
2. Laboratory days do not count toward this deadline. For consecutive experiments, the deadline shifts accordingly.
3. Late submission (≤3 days): grade penalty (0.3 reduction).
4. Late submission (>3 days): report may not be accepted without prior arrangement.
5. A report graded 5.0 receives one resubmission opportunity with feedback.
6. More than one report graded 5.0 results in course failure.

**FP-2 exception:** The two-week experiment does not require a written report. Results are presented in the seminar instead.

### Full Report Format

A full scientific report demonstrates your understanding through clear, honest, and well-structured communication.

| Element | Expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Introduction** | Context, motivation, and clear statement of objectives |
| **Method** | What you did and why; sufficient detail for replication |
| **Results** | Clear data presentation with appropriate visualisation and uncertainties |
| **Discussion** | Interpretation connected to physics principles; limitations acknowledged; alternative explanations considered |
| **Conclusion** | Key findings summarised; open questions identified |
| **References** | All sources acknowledged; own words used throughout |

**Quality markers:**
- Transparent assumptions explicitly stated
- Uncertainty analysis appropriate to the measurement
- Honest treatment of anomalies and unexpected results
- Logical flow from evidence to interpretation

### FP-EDU: Short Reports

Short reports follow the same principles as full reports but with reduced scope.

**Key differences:**
- Focus on essential findings and core analysis
- Briefer introduction and method sections
- Emphasis on quality of reasoning over comprehensiveness

**What remains unchanged:**
- Data must include uncertainties
- Analysis must be transparent
- Sources must be acknowledged
- Honest treatment of limitations

### FP-EDU: Labor-Spezial

The Labor-Spezial is specific to the Education programme. It connects experimental practice with didactic reflection across both phases.

**Learning phase (not graded):**
1. Practical work: a focused investigation or extension of an experimental aspect.
2. Didactic exploration: reflecting on how the experiment might be adapted for learners.
3. Documentation of both components.

**Exam phase (graded via seminar):**
1. The seminar presentation forms the exam phase of the Labor-Spezial.
2. The presentation must include explicit didactic reflection.
3. Assessment criteria:
   - Quality of physics understanding
   - Depth and integration of didactic reflection
   - Realism of adaptation proposals
   - Presentation quality and discussion engagement

**Note:** Didactic reflection is required in both phases. A presentation that treats didactic content as an afterthought does not meet the requirements.

---

## Part VI: Seminar

### Purpose

The seminar is where you present your work to a broader audience: fellow students, tutors, and organisers. It is part of the exam phase.

A good seminar presentation is not a summary — it is an argument. It should be coherent, causally connected, and invite active discussion.

### Session Structure

Each seminar session lasts 60 minutes and follows this structure:

| Element | Duration | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Uninterrupted presentation | ~30 minutes | Student presents without interruption |
| Honest discussion | ~15 minutes | Open discussion with all participants |
| Final exam questions | ~15 minutes | Focused questions from organisers and tutors |
| **Total** | **60 minutes** | |

### Presentation Requirements

**The following rules apply:**

1. The presentation must be coherent: a clear logical thread from beginning to end.
2. The presentation must be causally connected: claims should follow from evidence and reasoning.
3. The presentation must invite discussion: genuine questions, acknowledged uncertainties, openness to challenge.
4. Presentations are assessed against published criteria.

**Content should demonstrate:**
- Understanding of the physics (not just the procedure)
- Honest treatment of uncertainties and limitations
- Connection between theory and experimental findings
- Ability to respond to questions thoughtfully

### Discussion Phase

The 15-minute discussion phase is genuine inquiry — not examination.

**Guidelines:**
- All participants (fellow students, tutors, organisers) may ask questions.
- Questions should probe understanding and explore implications.
- Presenters should engage honestly — "I don't know" is acceptable.
- Divergent interpretations may be surfaced and discussed.

### Exam Questions Phase

The final 15-minute phase consists of focused questions from organisers and tutors.

**Guidelines:**
- Questions assess depth of understanding.
- Questions may probe areas not covered in the presentation.
- This phase contributes to the assessment.

### FP-2 (Master Laboratory)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Content | Results from the two-week experiment |
| Duration | 60 minutes (30 + 15 + 15) |
| Weight | 2.0 (double weight in overall grade) |
| Audience | Fellow students, tutors, organisers |

**Note:** Since the two-week experiment has no written report, the seminar presentation is the primary assessment for this experiment.

### FP-EDU (Fortgeschrittenenpraktikum Lehramt)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Content | Labor-Spezial results + didactic reflection |
| Duration | 60 minutes (30 + 15 + 15) |
| Weight | 1.5 (together with Labor-Spezial learning phase) |
| Audience | Fellow students, tutors, organisers |
| Special requirement | Must include didactic reflection throughout |

**Didactic component:** The seminar presentation forms the exam phase of the Labor-Spezial. Didactic reflection must be woven into the presentation — it should be integral, not an appendix. The presentation should address: How could this physics be communicated to learners? What are the key conceptual challenges? What adaptations would you propose, and why?

---

## Part VII: Rules for Students

### Your Role

You are here to engage seriously with physics — not because you are told to, but because serious engagement is the only way this becomes valuable. You are also here to learn how to communicate physics clearly and honestly.

**The following commitments apply:**

**Preparation:**
- Complete safety training before entering the laboratory.
- Read experiment guides thoroughly.
- Prepare for entrance conversations.

**During laboratory work:**
- Say when you do not understand — even when it feels exposing.
- Articulate your actual reasoning, not what you think is expected.
- Accept that divergence is legitimate.
- Propose ideas even when uncertain.
- State what would falsify your proposals, or acknowledge you cannot yet.
- Accept boundary markings as navigation, not judgment.

**Assessment:**
- Produce reports that reflect your genuine understanding.
- Meet deadlines or communicate in advance.
- Engage with feedback, even when difficult.
- Prepare seminar presentations that are coherent, causally connected, and invite discussion.

**FP-EDU additional commitments:**
- Engage in didactic reflection throughout — not just at the end.
- Explore how experiments might be adapted for learners.
- Integrate didactic content into your seminar presentation.
- Use the Labor-Spezial to connect practice and pedagogy meaningfully.

### What You Can Expect

You can expect the system to be fair — not because we promise it, but because the structure enforces it.

**The following protections apply:**

1. All assessment criteria are published before work begins.
2. The same criteria apply to all students for the same experiment.
3. Every grade includes written justification from a named tutor.
4. No criteria changes after submission.
5. Errors identified early can be corrected through defined paths.
6. Escalation paths exist and using them in good faith cannot lead to disadvantage.
7. Feedback is provided within stated deadlines.

### Deadlines Summary

| Deliverable | Deadline |
|-------------|----------|
| Safety training | Before first laboratory entry |
| Entrance conversation | Before measurements begin |
| Lab notebook | End of each session |
| Written report (where required) | 7 calendar days after final session (lab days excluded) |
| Seminar presentation | Per seminar schedule |
| Labor-Spezial learning phase (FP-EDU) | Per separate agreement |

### Consequences

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Late report (≤3 days) | Grade penalty (0.3 reduction) |
| Late report (>3 days) | May not be accepted without prior arrangement |
| Report graded 5.0 | Resubmission opportunity with feedback |
| Second report graded 5.0 | Course failure |
| More than 2 failed entrance conversations | Course failure |
| Safety violation (first, minor) | Removal from session, retraining, documented |
| Safety violation (repeated or serious) | Course exclusion |
| Academic integrity violation | Institutional process; likely course failure |

---

## Part VIII: Rules for Tutors

### Your Role

You accompany students through both learning and assessment. You do not do the work for them. You do not leave them alone with it. You remember that you once stood where they stand now.

**The following commitments apply:**

**Before the course:**
- Verify your own safety training is current (before semester start).
- Test equipment for your assigned experiments (2 weeks before course).
- Take your own measurements and verify the analysis works (2 weeks before course).
- Read the course documentation (before first session).

**During laboratory work:**
- Be present and prepared.
- Monitor safety at all times.
- Be available for questions.
- Observe by default during student-led discussions.
- Intervene only under T1/T2/T3 triggers.
- When you intervene, state your reason.
- Log all interventions.

**In honest discourse:**
- Listen before you speak.
- Ask clarifying questions before correcting.
- Accept that your expertise is a resource, not a conclusion.

**In exploration:**
- Hold the tether, not the direction.
- Ask "What would falsify this?" rather than "This is wrong."
- Protect the return path so no one gets lost.

**During seminar:**
- Participate in discussion phase as a genuine discussant.
- Prepare focused exam questions for the final phase.
- Assess against published criteria.

### Intervention Protocol

When you need to intervene during student-led activity:

1. Signal your intention (raise hand or agreed gesture).
2. State: "Intervening under [T1/T2/T3]: [brief reason]."
3. Make your intervention (maximum 2 minutes unless T1 safety).
4. Log the intervention before the session ends.

**If uncertain whether to intervene:**
- Default: do not intervene; note for feedback phase.
- Exception: T1 (safety) — intervene immediately, justify later.

### Feedback Deadlines

| Feedback type | Deadline |
|---------------|----------|
| Entrance conversation outcome | Immediate |
| Notebook check | Same or next session |
| Written report feedback | 14 calendar days |
| Oral feedback | Immediate (verbal); 7 days if written requested |
| Resubmission feedback | 10 calendar days |
| Seminar feedback | 7 calendar days |

**If you cannot meet a deadline:** Notify the student and the organiser before the deadline; state the new deadline.

### Grading Process

1. Assess written reports against the published criteria.
2. Assess seminar presentations against published criteria (content, discussion engagement, exam question responses).
3. Consult the organiser if the grade is unusual or you are uncertain.
4. Provide written feedback explaining the grade.
5. Enter grade and feedback in ILIAS.

### Grading Constraints

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Same criteria for all students on the same experiment | Fairness |
| No criteria changes after submission | No retroactive standards |
| Document any grade outside the typical range | Traceability |
| Store grades only in ILIAS | Accessibility |

### What Tutors May Not Do

| Prohibited | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Invent new criteria after submission | Violates fairness |
| Grant extensions beyond policy | Refer to organiser |
| Exclude a student from the laboratory | Requires organiser decision |
| Waive safety requirements | Not permitted |
| Supervise with expired training | Not permitted |
| Intervene without stating reason (in structured discussions) | Accountability |

---

## Part IX: Rules for Organisers

### Your Role

You create and maintain the conditions for serious work. You ensure tutors are prepared and supported. You respond when things go wrong.

**The following commitments apply:**

- Publish all criteria before they apply.
- Ensure tutors are prepared and supported.
- Respond to escalations within stated deadlines.
- Admit when something is your fault.
- Do not change rules retroactively.

### Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Criteria | Publish all assessment criteria before work begins |
| Tutors | Ensure training, preparation, and ongoing support |
| Equipment | Ensure functionality; resolve reported issues |
| Seminar | Schedule sessions; participate in discussion and exam phases |
| Escalations | Acknowledge within 2 working days; resolve within 10 working days |
| Auditing | Spot-check criteria application, intervention logs, grade justifications |
| Patterns | Identify and address systematic issues (tutor behaviour, equipment, procedures) |

### Escalation Response

| Escalation type | Acknowledgement | Resolution |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| From student | 2 working days | 10 working days |
| From tutor | 2 working days | 10 working days |
| To Dean | Per institutional policy | Per institutional policy |

If resolution requires longer: notify parties before deadline; state new timeline.

### What Organisers May Not Do

| Prohibited | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Change criteria after submission | No retroactive standards |
| Ignore escalations | Accountability |
| Override documented procedures without justification | Traceability |
| Disadvantage students for good-faith escalation | Protection |

---

## Part X: Safety

### Core Principle

Safety is not negotiable. It overrides all other considerations — learning objectives, schedules, convenience. When safety conflicts with anything else, safety wins.

**The following rules always apply:**

1. **Know before you touch.** If you do not understand equipment, ask before using it.
2. **Report problems immediately.** If something breaks, sparks, leaks, or behaves unexpectedly, tell someone at once.
3. **Never work alone with hazardous equipment.** Check the experiment guide for when a second person is required.

### Training Requirements

| Requirement | Deadline | Consequence of failure |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| General laboratory safety | Before first entry | No laboratory access |
| Electrical safety | Before first entry | No laboratory access |
| Experiment-specific modules | Before that experiment | No access to that experiment |
| Renewal | Every 12 months | Access suspended until renewed |

### Consequences of Violation

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| First minor violation | Immediate removal from session; retraining; documented |
| Repeated or serious violation | Course exclusion; possible institutional process |

### Emergency Stop

Any participant may halt activity at any time by invoking a safety concern. This:

1. Immediately stops all laboratory activity.
2. Activates standard safety protocols.
3. Requires logging the reason.
4. Requires scheduling follow-up within 5 working days.

No one may be disadvantaged for invoking a safety stop in good faith.

---

## Part XI: Escalation

### Principle

Problems should be resolved at the lowest appropriate level — but escalation paths exist for when that fails. Using them in good faith cannot lead to disadvantage.

### Student Escalation Path

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Try to resolve with tutor (unless the problem is the tutor) |
| 2 | If unresolved within 7 days: email organiser |
| 3 | Include: what happened, what you tried, what you want |
| 4 | Keep copies of all communications |
| 5 | If organiser does not respond within deadlines, or problem is organiser: email Dean of Studies |

### Tutor Escalation Path

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Try to resolve within your authority |
| 2 | If you cannot: email organiser |
| 3 | Include: what happened, what you did, what decision you need |
| 4 | If organiser does not respond: escalate to Dean |

### Response Deadlines

| Path | Acknowledgement | Resolution |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Student → Tutor | Same or next session | 7 days |
| Student → Organiser | 2 working days | 10 working days |
| Tutor → Organiser | 2 working days | 10 working days |
| Anyone → Dean | Per institutional policy | Per institutional policy |

### FP-EDU Additional Path

For issues specific to the Education programme (e.g., didactic components, programme requirements), the Centre for Teacher Education (Zentrum für Lehrerbildung) may be consulted as an additional resource.

---

## Part XII: Scientific Integrity

### Core Principles

- **Do not fabricate data.** Record what you observe, not what you expect.
- **Do not falsify data.** Do not alter, omit, or misrepresent results.
- **Do not plagiarise.** Acknowledge all sources. Use your own words.
- **Document everything.** Your notebook must allow verification.

### Institutional Framework

The University of Freiburg's regulations on safeguarding academic integrity apply. Violations are serious and may result in course failure or further consequences.

### Resources

- University of Freiburg: Academic Integrity
- Institute of Physics: Scientific Honesty
- DFG Code of Conduct for Good Scientific Practice
