# Get Ready: Electromagnetically Induced Transparency

**Master Lab Course — Physikalisches Institut, Universität Freiburg**

## The Pull

Light normally gets absorbed when it passes through a dense atomic medium. But with the right preparation — two laser fields, precisely tuned, coherently driving a three-level system — you can open a window of transparency exactly where absorption should be strongest. This is Electromagnetically Induced Transparency: a quantum interference effect that makes opaque media transparent, slows light to walking pace, and enables the storage of photons in atomic spin waves.

These are not textbook curiosities. EIT underpins quantum memory protocols, precision magnetometry, and coherent control techniques used across atomic physics. You will build and operate a complete EIT system — from laser stabilisation to light storage.

This is not a fixed recipe. This is a developing platform.

## Guiding Question

> **How do we establish and optimise the coherent conditions required for EIT in a warm rubidium vapour — and what limits the transparency, the magnetic sensitivity, and the light storage fidelity we can achieve?**

---

## What Makes This Lab Different

You inherit an experimental apparatus that has been built, aligned, and refined by previous student groups. Your task is twofold:

1. **Do science**: Lock a laser to an atomic transition, generate control and signal beams with precise frequency differences, observe EIT resonances, measure magnetic fields via Zeeman shifts, and store light pulses in atomic coherences.

2. **Improve the platform**: Each group encounters different challenges and finds different solutions. We actively welcome your input on optical alignment procedures, electronic filtering, data acquisition workflows, polarisation control, or any aspect of the apparatus that could work better.

This reflects how experimental atomic physics actually operates: you build on accumulated knowledge, you diagnose problems systematically, and you document what you learn for those who follow.

## Before You Arrive

The lab runs over two weeks with distinct objectives. Please prepare accordingly.

### Week 1 — Laser Characterisation and Stabilisation

Work through Sections II.A–C of the detailed instructions:

- **Section II.A** — Describe the three basic elements required to build a laser. Sketch how an external-cavity diode laser achieves power and wavelength tuning. How does a Fabry–Pérot interferometer measure wavelength differences?

- **Section II.B** — Explain the difference between absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Illustrate the principle of saturation spectroscopy. Sketch the ⁸⁷Rb level scheme for S₁/₂ and P₁/₂ states and identify allowed E1 transitions using selection rules.

- **Section II.C** — Describe the operating principle of a lock-in amplifier. What are the general features of a PID controller?

### Week 2 — Coherent Control and EIT

Work through Sections III.A–D:

- **Section III.A** — Describe the principle of optical heterodyne detection. What are the key characteristics of a polarisation-maintaining fibre?

- **Section III.B** — What conditions must be satisfied for EIT to occur? Calculate the one-photon Rabi rate for the |5²S₁/₂, F=2⟩ → |5²P₁/₂, F=1⟩ transition with 200 µW power and 1 mm beam diameter.

- **Section III.C** — Calculate the Zeeman splitting of the ⁸⁷Rb ground states as a function of magnetic field strength.

- **Section III.D** — Sketch a pulse sequence suitable for a light storage experiment.

Use the keywords listed in each section to guide your reading. The review article by Fleischhauer, Imamoglu & Marangos [Ref. 2] provides essential theoretical background.

## Safety Reminder

The diode laser is a **Class-3b system** (up to 100 mW at 780 nm). Appropriate laser safety goggles must be worn whenever the laser is operating.

The EIT chamber is temperature-stabilised to approximately **95 °C**. Do not touch the chamber surfaces.

Do not disconnect acousto-optical modulators while RF amplifiers are powered. Ensure RF input power remains below 10 dBm.

## What We Value

- **Systematic calibration**: Understand your instruments before trusting your data.
- **Quantitative analysis**: Fit models to spectra, propagate uncertainties, compare with theory.
- **Clear documentation**: Sketches, parameter lists, file names, reasoning — all in your lab notes.
- **Constructive feedback**: If alignment is fragile, if a signal is noisy, if a procedure is unclear — tell us. Your observations improve the next iteration.
