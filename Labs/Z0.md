## Why This Experiment Matters

In the late 1980s, physicists at CERN faced a fundamental question: **How many types of matter exist in the universe?**

The Standard Model predicted three generations of particles — but prediction is not proof. The answer came from a particle that lives for only 10⁻²⁵ seconds: the Z⁰ boson.

Here's the key insight: the Z⁰ decays into all light particles, including neutrinos we cannot directly detect. Each additional neutrino species shortens the Z⁰'s lifetime and broadens its resonance peak. By measuring the peak's width with precision, LEP physicists counted the invisible — and found exactly three.

This result closed the door on a fourth generation of light matter. It remains one of the most elegant examples of how precision measurement answers questions that seem unanswerable.

### Guiding Question

> **How can we determine the number of fundamental particle families by measuring what we cannot see?**

Your task is to retrace this discovery. You will analyse real collision data from the OPAL detector, classify decay events, and extract the Z⁰ mass, width, and decay properties. From these measurements, you will constrain the number of light neutrino generations — just as it was done when this question was still open.

This is not a simulation. This is the actual data that answered a fundamental question about nature.

## Overview

In this experiment, you analyse Z⁰ boson decays recorded by the OPAL detector at the LEP collider (CERN). You will:

- Classify decay events using the GROPE event display
- Perform a statistical analysis of decay channels
- Extract precision measurements from the data

## Main Laboratory Manual

The primary reference for this experiment is the **E213 Laboratory Manual** (available on ILIAS).

The manual covers three integrated layers:

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Physics Background** | Electroweak and strong interactions, Z⁰ production near resonance, Breit–Wigner cross sections, partial decay widths, forward–backward asymmetry, radiative corrections (QED/QCD) |
| **Experimental Context** | LEP storage ring, OPAL detector components (tracking, calorimeters, muon system, trigger), event topologies for leptonic and hadronic decays, selection criteria |
| **Analysis Workflow** | Part I: graphical event inspection and particle identification; Part II: statistical analysis, extraction of Z mass and width, asymmetries, comparison with Standard Model |

Appendices provide constants, kinematics, Monte-Carlo variables, and reference formulas.

**Read the E213 manual thoroughly before your entrance session.**

## Before the Experiment

### Technical Setup

Please complete the following setup **before your entrance session**. This allows you to begin the experiment immediately after Step 1.

#### 1. Virtual Machine for Event Display (GROPE)

The GROPE program displays Z⁰ decay events from the OPAL experiment. It runs in a virtual environment.

**Installation:**

1. Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/
2. Download the appliance file: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/x9rfJSKSPHtqNEJ  
   (Password: `higgs`)
3. In VirtualBox: *File → Import Appliance* and select the downloaded file
4. Start the virtual machine
5. Double-click "Grope" on the desktop
6. If the screen locks, the password is `higgs`

#### 2. Statistical Analysis Environment

The analysis code and instructions are provided in a GitHub repository:

> https://github.com/josepretel/z0-precisionmeasurement/

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook with analysis instructions and example code using `uproot` (a Python-based ROOT file reader). C++ ROOT macros are also available.

**Option A: Google Colab (no local installation)**

1. Open https://colab.research.google.com
2. Go to the "GitHub" tab
3. Enter user `josepretel`, select repository `z0-precisionmeasurement`, branch `main`
4. Open `z0_experiment.ipynb`
5. Upload the data (~100 MB) to your Google Drive and link it in the notebook

**Option B: Local Conda Environment**

1. Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `conda env create` (reads `environment.yml` and installs dependencies)
4. Activate: `conda activate z0-env`
5. Start: `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook`

**Option C: ROOT / pyROOT**

Follow the ROOT installation instructions at https://root.cern/install/

For pyROOT, install additional libraries:
```
pip install uproot awkward mplhep numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## During the Experiment

### Workflow

1. **Event Classification:** Use GROPE to visually classify Z⁰ decay events into channels (leptons, hadrons)
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Process the dataset using the provided code framework
3. **Precision Measurement:** Extract physical quantities and estimate uncertainties

### Data Access

The full dataset for statistical analysis will be provided after completing the entrance session (Step 1).

### Version Control

Your analysis code and results are tracked via GitHub. Submit your final results through a merge request to your repository. Your tutors will provide specific instructions.

## Recommended Literature

### What to Focus On

For this experiment, you should understand:
- Z⁰ boson properties (mass, width, couplings)
- Decay channels: leptonic (e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻) vs hadronic
- Branching ratios and how they constrain the Standard Model
- LEP/OPAL experiment basics

### Open Access Resources

| Resource | Focus | Link |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Particle Data Group (PDG)** | Authoritative reference for Z⁰ properties, branching ratios, Standard Model summary | https://pdg.lbl.gov |

### Introductory Textbooks

| Book | Why Suitable |
|------|--------------|
| **Griffiths — *Introduction to Elementary Particles*** | Ideal entry point. Clear, readable, minimal prerequisites. Covers Standard Model, Feynman diagrams, electroweak theory at accessible level. |
| **Thomson — *Modern Particle Physics*** | More recent (2013), comprehensive, includes LEP/LHC context. Good balance of theory and experiment. |
| **Povh, Rith, Scholz, Zetsche — *Particles and Nuclei*** | German classic (also in English). Excellent for experimental perspective. |

### Intermediate Textbooks

| Book | Why Suitable |
|------|--------------|
| **Halzen & Martin — *Quarks and Leptons*** | Standard graduate text. More rigorous than Griffiths, still accessible. Strong on electroweak physics. |
| **Perkins — *Introduction to High Energy Physics*** | Experimental focus. Good for understanding detector physics and event classification. |

### Minimum Preparation

If you have not had a particle physics course:
- Read the E213 Laboratory Manual (essential)
- Consult the PDG Z-boson summary
- Work through Griffiths Chapters 1–3 and 9–10

Your tutors can provide further guidance.
