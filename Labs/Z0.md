# Z⁰ Decay Experiment

**Advanced Laboratory Course FP-2**  
University of Freiburg, Institute of Physics

---

## Overview

In this experiment, you analyse Z⁰ boson decays recorded by the OPAL detector at the LEP collider (CERN). You will:

- Classify decay events using the GROPE event display
- Perform a statistical analysis of decay channels
- Extract precision measurements from the data

---

## Before the Experiment

### Technical Setup

Please complete the following setup **before your entrance session**. This allows you to begin the experiment immediately after Step 1.

#### 1. Virtual Machine for Event Display (GROPE)

The GROPE program displays Z⁰ decay events from the OPAL experiment. It runs in a virtual environment.

**Installation:**

1. Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/
2. Download the appliance file: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/x9rfJSKSPHtqNEJ  
   (Password: `higgs`)
3. In VirtualBox: *File → Import Appliance* and select the downloaded file
4. Start the virtual machine
5. Double-click "Grope" on the desktop
6. If the screen locks, the password is `higgs`

#### 2. Statistical Analysis Environment

The analysis code and instructions are provided in a GitHub repository:

> https://github.com/josepretel/z0-precisionmeasurement/

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook with analysis instructions and example code using `uproot` (a Python-based ROOT file reader). C++ ROOT macros are also available.

**Option A: Google Colab (no local installation)**

1. Open https://colab.research.google.com
2. Go to the "GitHub" tab
3. Enter user `josepretel`, select repository `z0-precisionmeasurement`, branch `main`
4. Open `z0_experiment.ipynb`
5. Upload the data (~100 MB) to your Google Drive and link it in the notebook

**Option B: Local Conda Environment**

1. Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `conda env create` (reads `environment.yml` and installs dependencies)
4. Activate: `conda activate z0-env`
5. Start: `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook`

**Option C: ROOT / pyROOT**

Follow the ROOT installation instructions at https://root.cern/install/

For pyROOT, install additional libraries:
```
pip install uproot awkward mplhep numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## During the Experiment

### Workflow

1. **Event Classification:** Use GROPE to visually classify Z⁰ decay events into channels (leptons, hadrons)
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Process the dataset using the provided code framework
3. **Precision Measurement:** Extract physical quantities and estimate uncertainties

### Data Access

The full dataset for statistical analysis will be provided after completing the entrance session (Step 1).

### Version Control

Your analysis code and results are tracked via GitHub. Submit your final results through a merge request to your repository. Your tutors will provide specific instructions.

## Recommended Preparation

If you have not had a course in particle physics, consult the introductory literature in the ILIAS folder before the entrance session. Focus on:

- The Standard Model and the Z⁰ boson
- Decay channels and branching ratios
- Basic concepts of collider experiments

Your tutors can provide further guidance on preparation.
