# Get Ready: Diamonds for Sensing Applications

## The Pull

Quantum sensors are reshaping precision measurement. Unlike trapped atoms that demand ultra-high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond operate at room temperature, on your benchtop, potentially even inside living cells. You are about to work with one of the most promising platforms for nanoscale magnetometry — and the techniques you will learn connect directly to atomic clocks, quantum information, and cutting-edge metrology.

This is not a cookbook experiment. This is a sandbox.

## Guiding Question

> **How can we systematically characterise and optimise NV-centre fluorescence and magnetic resonance signals to develop a reliable, sensitive magnetometer — and what improvements to the apparatus would make this easier for the next team?**

## What Makes This Lab Different

You inherit an evolving experimental setup. Previous student groups have built, calibrated, and refined this apparatus. Your task is twofold:

1. **Do science**: Characterise diamonds, record fluorescence spectra, measure optically detected magnetic resonances (ODMR), and extract quantitative results with proper uncertainty analysis.

2. **Improve the platform**: Each group contributes something different. We actively welcome your input on how to improve the mechanical stability, optical alignment, electronic signal chain, data acquisition workflow, or analysis procedures.

This mirrors how real experimental physics works: you rarely start from scratch, you build on what came before, and you leave things better than you found them.

## Before You Arrive

Please work through the following preparation tasks from the detailed instructions:

- **Section I.A** — What are the possible spatial orientations of NV centres within the diamond lattice? How are they specified using Miller indices?

- **Section I.B** — Sketch a simplified energy level diagram for NV⁻. Label the key transitions and explain the physical basis for magnetic field sensing. Write down and discuss the Zeeman splitting formula.

- **Section I.C** — Explain the processes that produce an ODMR signal. How do the optical and microwave fields work together?

- **Section II** — Familiarise yourself with the main components: the 519 nm diode laser, avalanche photodiode, spectrum analyser with tracking generator, microwave amplifier chain, and coplanar waveguide. What is each used for?

Use the keywords listed in each section to guide your reading. The thesis of D. Palani [Ref. 22 in the instructions] provides additional depth if needed.

## Safety Reminder

The diode laser is a **Class-3b system** (up to 100 mW at 519 nm). Appropriate laser safety goggles must be worn whenever the laser is operating. No exceptions.

---

## What We Value

- **Rigorous documentation**: Handwritten lab notes, sketches of your setups, parameter lists with uncertainties, file names for data runs.
- **Quantitative analysis**: Model fits, uncertainty propagation, calibration awareness.
- **Constructive feedback**: If something is awkward, fragile, confusing, or slow — tell us. Your observations drive improvements.
- **Scientific honesty**: Report what you measure, including when things do not work as expected.
