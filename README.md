# Advanced Master Laboratory Documentation
Ulrich Warring, Institute of Physics, University of Freiburg, Germany

## Structure

One document, three layers:

| Part | Purpose | Enforceability |
|------|---------|----------------|
| I. Framework | Invariant principles | Cannot be overridden |
| II. Essay | Role commitments | Spirit, not letter |
| III. Handbook | Procedures and deadlines | Enforceable |

This separation is deliberate. Mixing why/how/who creates ambiguity that harms students.

## Key Design Decisions

**Two-phase model:** Learning (prep + lab) and assessment (reports only). Grades come from written reports and accompanying oral presentations. The lab is for learning—tutors teach, mistakes are expected.

**Tutors are learners:** They have more experience than students but are still learning. Before each course, tutors test equipment, take measurements, and verify their understanding. This is acknowledged, not hidden.

**Complete accountability chain:** Students → Tutors → Organisers → Dean of Studies. Everyone is accountable to someone. Visibility creates accountability.

**Modernization in progress:** Lab instructions vary in format. Legacy and new coexist. Forcing uniformity would compromise quality.

## Reading Guide

| If you are... | Start with |
|---------------|------------|
| Student | Part III, Chapters 2, 3, 6 |
| Tutor | Part III, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6 |
| Organiser | Everything |
| Anyone wanting context | Part II (Essay) |

## Principles (Part I Summary)

1. **Known Criteria** — judge only on criteria visible beforehand
2. **Proportional Authority** — responsible only for what you control
3. **Traceable Decisions** — every decision has a name and reason
4. **Separation of Layers** — why/how/who kept distinct
5. **Symmetric Visibility** — all rules visible to all roles
6. **Correctable Error** — one mistake does not end participation

## Version

1.0 — Initial unified release

## Changes

Propose changes in writing to an organiser. Framework changes require two organisers. Changes take effect only when published with a new version number.
