# Advanced Physics Laboratory Courses

Documentation for the Master Laboratory (FP-2) and Teacher Education Laboratory (FP-EDU) at the University of Freiburg, Institute of Physics.

## What This Is

These are advanced laboratory courses where students engage with physics as scientists — making decisions, handling surprises, and solving problems without pre-written answers.

We're rebuilding the course documentation to make it clearer, fairer, and more honest about how things work.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional laboratory courses often have hidden rules. Students don't always know how they'll be graded. Power imbalances between tutors and students can discourage honest questions. When things go wrong, it's not always clear who is responsible for what.

This creates anxiety and rewards performance over genuine learning.

## Our Approach

We're designing the courses around three simple ideas:

### 1. Fairness You Can Check

- All grading criteria are published before work begins
- Every grade comes with a written explanation and a name
- If you make a correctable mistake, there's a defined path to fix it
- The same rules apply to everyone — including tutors and organisers

### 2. Honest Conversation

- Students lead discussions about physics
- Tutors observe by default and only step in when necessary
- When tutors intervene, they say why
- Disagreement is allowed — not everything needs consensus

### 3. Structured Exploration

- Creativity is encouraged, but grounded
- If you're speculating, you should be able to say what would prove you wrong
- Wild ideas get marked, not punished
- Exploration produces possibilities; conclusions require discussion

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.2 (Draft)  
**Status:** Under review 

The documentation is being developed iteratively. We're testing ideas, gathering feedback, and refining the language. Nothing is final until it's marked as final.

## The Process

We're not trying to invent something completely new. We're trying to write down what good teaching already looks like — and then make sure the structure actually delivers it.

The steps:

1. **Identify what matters** — fairness, honest discourse, room to explore
2. **Write it down clearly** — so everyone knows the rules
3. **Build in accountability** — so the rules actually hold
4. **Test and refine** — fix what doesn't work

This is ongoing work. The goal is courses where students can focus on physics because they trust the system is fair — and tutors can focus on teaching because they know what's expected of them.

## Guiding Principles

We started with a simple question: what would a laboratory course look like if we took respect, trust, and responsibility seriously?

- **Respect** means treating students as capable of doing real physics, and treating tutors as professionals who need support, not just instructions.
- **Trust** means being transparent about how things work, so people can rely on the system.
- **Responsibility** means everyone — students, tutors, organisers — is accountable for their part.

The documentation tries to turn these ideas into concrete rules and procedures.

This is primarily an internal project, but the approach may be useful to others designing laboratory courses. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
