# Advanced Physics Laboratory Documentation

## Structure

One document, three layers:

| Part | Purpose | In plain language |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| I. Framework | Invariant principles | The promises we make to you |
| II. Essay | Role commitments | What we are trying to do |
| III. Handbook | Procedures and deadlines | The rulebook—if it's not here, it cannot be used against you |

This separation is deliberate. Mixing why/how/who creates ambiguity that disadvantages whoever has less power.

## Key Design Decisions

**Two-phase model:** Learning (prep + lab) and assessment (reports only). Grades come from written reports and accompanying oral presentations. The lab is for learning—tutors teach, mistakes are expected.

**Tutors are learners:** They have more experience than students but are still learning. Before each course, tutors test equipment, take measurements, and verify their understanding. This is acknowledged, not hidden.

**Complete accountability chain:** Students → Tutors → Organisers → Dean of Studies. Everyone is accountable to someone. When escalation is possible and the process is known, problems are more likely to be addressed early.

**Modernization in progress:** Lab instructions vary in format. Legacy and new coexist. Forcing uniformity would compromise quality.

**Scientific honesty:** Chapter 8 states core principles (no fabrication, no falsification, no plagiarism, document everything) with links to university and DFG guidelines. This is non-negotiable.

**Legal hierarchy explicit:** University and faculty regulations take precedence. This document fills in local practice within that framework.

**Entrance procedure clarity:** Three distinct outcomes (Passed/Repeated/Failed) with definitions. Only "Failed" (sent home to reschedule) counts toward the hard limit. Mandatory checkbox on feedback form ensures consistent recording.

**Canonical version on ILIAS:** The authoritative version is always on ILIAS. Check there for updates.

## Reading Guide

| If you are... | Start with |
|---------------|------------|
| In a hurry | Quick Reference (protections, deadlines, escalation paths) |
| Student | Part III, Chapters 2, 3, 6, 8 |
| Tutor | Part III, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, Appendix B |
| Organiser | Everything |
| Anyone wanting context | Part II (Essay) |

## Appendices

- **Appendix A: Grading Scheme** — Grade scale, weights, course-specific calculations, entrance procedure definitions (Passed/Repeated/Failed)
- **Appendix B: Feedback Template** — Mandatory form for all graded work (entrance outcome checkbox, four quality markers per phase, written feedback required)
- **Appendix C: Document Metadata**

## Principles (Part I Summary)

1. **Known Criteria** — assess only on criteria visible beforehand
2. **Proportional Authority** — responsible only for what you could reasonably influence
3. **Traceable Decisions** — every decision has a name and reason
4. **Separation of Layers** — why/how/who kept distinct
5. **Symmetric Visibility** — all rules visible to all roles
6. **Correctable Error** — one mistake does not end participation

## Changes

Propose changes in writing to an organiser. Framework changes require two organisers. Changes take effect only when published with a new version number.
