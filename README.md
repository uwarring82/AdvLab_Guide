# Advanced Physics Laboratory Documentation

## Structure

One document, three layers:

|Part         |Purpose                 |Enforceability      |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------|
|I. Framework |Invariant principles    |Cannot be overridden|
|II. Essay    |Role commitments        |Spirit, not letter  |
|III. Handbook|Procedures and deadlines|Enforceable         |

This separation is deliberate. Mixing why/how/who creates ambiguity that harms students.

## Key Design Decisions

**Two-phase model:** Learning (prep + lab) and assessment (reports only). Grades come from reports. The lab is for learning—tutors teach, mistakes are expected.

**Tutors are learners:** They have more experience than students but are still learning. This is acknowledged, not hidden.

**Complete accountability chain:** Students → Tutors → Organisers → Dean of Studies. Everyone is accountable to someone. Visibility creates accountability.

**Modernization in progress:** Lab instructions vary in format. Legacy and new coexist. Forcing uniformity would compromise quality.

## Principles (Part I Summary)

1. **Known Criteria** — judge only on criteria visible beforehand
1. **Proportional Authority** — responsible only for what you control
1. **Traceable Decisions** — every decision has a name and reason
1. **Separation of Layers** — why/how/who kept distinct
1. **Symmetric Visibility** — all rules visible to all roles
1. **Correctable Error** — one mistake does not end participation
